LSE 'sets date for takeover deal',"The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month, newspaper report claim. The Sunday Telegraph said the LSE's plan wa further evidence it want to retain tight control over it destiny. Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talk with the London market last week over a possible offer.

Despite insisting he want to agree a recommended deal with the LSE's board, the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholder instead. The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert wa becoming ""increasingly frustrated"" with the pace of negotiation since Deutsche Boerse's Â£1.3bn offer wa rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE's decision to suspend talk over the Christmas period. Meanwhile, the German exchange's offer ha come under fire recently. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fear that up to 300 job would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. Others claim it will weaken the city's status a Europe's financial centre, while German politician are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move it headquarters to London if a bid is successful. A further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse's control over it Clearstream unit, the clearing house that process security transactions.

Campaign 'cold calls' questioned,"Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the million of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing ""cold calls"". The party say they can stick to the rule by ensuring that their call are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rule to stop the calls. The information commissioner's office say survey are allowed but people had to be told if personal data wa kept. Telephone call centre are expected to be used a never before by all the three major party in the run-up to the general election. But seven million telephone number are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sale and marketing calls. Both scheme are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directive on privacy and electronic communications. The rule on marketing call apply a much to politician a to private sector companies. But that doe not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS list when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. But that did not happen for ""voter identification"" calls. ""When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,"" he said. ""So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service."" He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rule when it rang TPS subscribers. She said: ""We do apply TPS but in line with the law. We would not do thing that are not allowed in the law."" Assistant information commissioner Phil Jones said it wa classed a marketing if political party telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. But ""classic market research"", such a a poll of voter intentions, did not constitute direct marketing, he said. ""If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and record their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned,"" said Mr Jones. ""If a party ring a person who is registered on TPS to ask about their voting intention and go on to encourage that voter to support them, the party may well be in breach of the regulations. ""In summary, whether a party calling TPS registered voter to check their voting intention will breach regulation will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed."" Mr Jones said the watchdog received ""very few complaints"" on the issue. Earlier, Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor wrote to the watchdog saying: ""The advice we have received on several previous occasion is that such phone call are illegal."" He say evidence from local Lib Dem party around the country suggests there are ""significant"" number of such calls.

Australia rates at four year high,"Australia is raising it benchmark interest rate to it highest level in four year despite sign of a slowdown in the country's economy.

EU-US seeking deal on air dispute,"The EU and US have agreed to begin talk on ending subsidy given to aircraft makers, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson ha announced. Both side hope to reach a negotiated deal over state aid received by European aircraft maker Airbus and it US rival Boeing, Mr Mandelson said. Airbus and Boeing accuse each other of benefiting from illegal subsidies. Mr Mandelson said the EU and US hoped to avoid having to resolve the dispute at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). ""With this agreement the EU and US have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute which ha arisen between them,"" Mr Mandelson said. ""I hope our negotiation in the next three month will lead to an agreement ending subsidy to development and production of large civil aircraft."" Last year, the US terminated an agreement with the EU, reached in 1992, which limit the subsidy country can hand over to civil aircraft makers. The US filed a complaint against Brussels with the WTO over state aid to Airbus, prompting a retaliatory EU complaint over US support for Boeing. However, both side agreed to suspend their request for WTO arbitration at the beginning of December, to allow bilateral talk to continue. EADS and BAE Systems, the European defence and aerospace firm which own Airbus, welcomed Mr Mandelson's announcement.

WorldCom bosses' $54m payout,"Ten former director at WorldCom have agreed to pay $54m (Â£28.85m), including $18m from their own pockets, to settle a class action lawsuit, report say. James Wareham, a lawyer representing one of the directors, told Reuters the 10 had agreed to pay those who lost billion when the firm collapsed. The remaining $36m will be paid by the directors' insurers. But, a spokesman for the prosecutor, New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, said no formal agreement had been made. Corporate governance expert said that if the director do dip into their own pocket for the settlement, it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses, when the firm they oversee face problems. ""Directors very rarely pay,"" said Charles Elson, chairman of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. He added that the settlement ""sends a pretty strong shockwave through the director world"". A formal agreement on the payout is expected to be signed on Thursday in a US district court in Manhattan. Earlier, the New York Times had reported that the personal payment were required a part of any deal at the start of negotiations. The ten former outside director are James Allen, Judith Areen, Carl Aycock, Max Bobbitt, Clifford Alexander, Stiles Kellett, Gordon Macklin, John Porter, Lawrence Tucker and the estate of John Sidgmore, who died last year.

Apple laptop is 'greatest gadget',"The Apple Powerbook 100 ha been chosen a the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC. The 1991 laptop wa chosen because it wa one of the first ""lightweight"" portable computer and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs. The magazine ha compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving part and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. The magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadget also needed to be a ""self-contained apparatus that can be used on it own, not a subset of another device"". ""In general we included only item that were potentially mobile,"" said the magazine. ""In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really make a gadget a gadget,"" it concluded. The oldest ""gadget"" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine date at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place. Other pre-electronic gadget in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamond Multimedia), a well a the first ""successful"" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac). The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13. Sony's third entry in the top 20 is the CDP-101 CD player from 1983. ""Who can forget the crystalline, hiss-free blast of Madonna's Like A Virgin emanating from their first CD player?"" asked the magazine. Karl Elsener's knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list. Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th), 1990s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th). Almost everyone ha a mobile phone, how many people own a Powerbook? or an iPod? The finding of this magazine are not very convincing. What about the magnetic compass? We still use it 1,000 year after it wa invented. I am amazed by the obsession with individual gadget rather than genre. For example the Sony walkman wa the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas Minidisc, Flash MP3, portable CD player etc. are really just improvement in technology. My favourite 'true' gadget are probably my portable MiniDisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing I use to froth up my coffee! Calm down it's only in their opinion, and any list that includes the Taser in the top 100 gadget ha to be suspect.... Swiss army knife and no question about it. How many of the other item are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still a useful/popular? You don't need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out! This list merely illustrates interesting cultural divide between the American author and the overwhelmingly British responses. Brits see no further than mobile phone and the over thirty Sinclair; whilst the Americans focus on Apple, TV remote and TiVO (which probably is rather obscure in Europe). What about the Soda Stream. This gadget changed my pre-teen life. Lap top may enable you to ""think different, but you cant use them to ""get busy with the fizzy"" How about Astro Wars, one of the pioneer for computer games, i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still work today! However tried it the other day and it wa rubbish, still a great gadget of it time. Why worry about mobile phones. Soon they will be subsumed into the PDA's / laptop etc. What about the Marine Chronometer? Completely revolutionised navigation for boat and wa in use for centuries. For it's time, a technological marvel! Sony Net Minidisc! It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. I always used my NetMD, and could not go anywhere without it. A laptop computer is not a gadget! It's a working tool! The Sinclair Executive wa the world's first pocket calculator. I think this should be there a well. How about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or a pocket calculator? All these thing are useful to real people, not just PC magazine editors. Are the people who created this list insane ? Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone? It ha revolutionised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation system would not have evolved so quickly. Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker?? An interesting list. Of the electronic gadgets, thousand of journalist in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100. The size of A4 paper and light, three week on a set of batteries, an excellent keyboard, a modem. A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible. What's an Apple Powerbook 100 ? It's out of date - not much of a ""gadget"". Surely it ha to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener, Swiss Army Knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch or the thing for taking stone out of horse hoof ? It ha to be the mobile phone. No other single device ha had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time. The ball point pen ha got to be one of the most used and common gadget ever. Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which wa a great improvement over the slide rule. The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noise wa also a hot gadget in 1980. A true gadget, it could be carried around and shown off. All top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anything else. I say this a the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20. Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of it time. The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS. Shame the marketing wa so bad!!! Apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else. Utter rubbish. Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets. But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank them a less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture ha developed. No competition. I'd also put Apple's Newton and the first Palm Pilot there a the front runner for portable computing, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason. I only wish that Vulcan Inc's Flipstart wasn't just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top. How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)? What about radio and TVs? The swiss army knife. By far the most useful gadget. I got mine 12 year ago. Still wearing and using it a lot! It stood the test of time. Psion Organiser series 3, should be up there. Had a usable qwerty keyboard, removable storage, good set of apps and programmable. Case design wa good (batteries in the hinge - a first, I think). Great product innovation. The first mobile PC wa voted best gadget by reader of...err... mobile PC?! Why do you keep putting these obviously biased list on your site? It's obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and reader of a less partisan publication would tell you that. The Motorola Startac should be Number One. Why? There will be mobile phone long after notebook computer and other gadget are either gone or integrated in communication devices. The Psion series 3c! The first most practical way to carry all your info around... I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now. I'd have put the mobile phone high up the list. Probably a Nokia model. Sinclair Spectrum - 16k. It plugged into the tv. Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that's what I do for a living now. I wish more modern notebook -- even Apple's newest offering -- were more like the PB100. Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball, which ha given way to the largely useless ""trackpad"" which every notebook on the market today uses. They're invariably inaccurate, uncomfortable, and cumbersome to use.

Strachan turns down Pompey,"Former Southampton manager Gordon Strachan ha rejected the chance to become Portsmouth's new boss.

Club director Terry Brady held initial talk with Strachan on Saturday. The former Scotland international added that joining Southampton's local rival would not be a wise move. ""It's got everything going for it but I've got too many memory of the other side and I don't want to sour those memories,"" he said.

Wi-fi web reaches farmers in Peru,"A network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmer in Peru. The pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley, 80 kilometre north of the capital Lima, aim to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market price and trends. The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay-Huaral Valley also provides vital link between local organisation in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions. More than 13,000 rural inhabitants, a well a 18,000 student in the region, will also benefit from the telecom infrastructure. The 14 telecentres us only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. The network ha been three year in the making and wa officially inaugurated in September. The non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) led the $200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the Education and Agriculture ministries, and European development organisations. ""The plan includes training on computer and internet skill for both operator and user of the system,"" said Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes. Farmers are also taking extra lesson on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plot of land. The Board of Irrigation Users which run the computer centres, aim to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres a internet cafes. One of the key element of the project is the Agricultural Information System, with it flagship huaral.org website. There, farmer can find the price for local produce, a well a information on topic ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. The system also help the inhabitant of the Chancay-Huaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. ""Water is the main element that unites them all. It is a precious element in Peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation system to make the most of it,"" Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website. The information network also allows farmer to look beyond their own region, and share experience with other colleague from the rest of Peru and even around the world. Cepes say the involvement of the farmer ha been key in the project's success. ""Throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them,"" said Mr Saldarriaga. The community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. ""We have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. But we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives."" So far, the Huaral programme promoter say the experience ha been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisation in Peru. ""This is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on it cloning potential in other places,"" underlined Mr Saldarriaga.

""It wa already dark when the technician realised they didn't have any light bulb to test the generator, so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs,"" recall Carlos Saldarriaga.

"UK needs tax cuts, Tories insist","A major change of direction is needed in Britain if it is to prosper, the shadow chancellor said a the Tory Party spring conference began.

Robots learn 'robotiquette' rules,"Robots are learning lesson on ""robotiquette"" - how to behave socially - so they can mix better with humans. By playing games, like pass-the-parcel, a University of Hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companion should react in social situations. The study's finding will eventually help human develop a code of social behaviour in human-robot interaction. The work is part of the European Cogniron robotics project, and wa on show at London's Science Museum. ""We are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists,"" said Professor Kerstin Dautenhahn, project leader at Hertfordshire. ""Our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal space of humans."" The research also focus on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skill by imitating a human demonstrator. ""Without such studies, you will build robot which might not respect the fact that human are individuals, have preference and come from different cultural backgrounds,"" Professor Dautenhahn told BBC News Online. ""And I want robot to treat human a human beings, and not like other robots,"" she added. In most situations, a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person, but also with group of people. To find out how they would react, the Hertfordshire Cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children. Showing off it skill at the Science Museum, the unnamed robot had to select, approach, and ask different child to pick up a parcel with a gift, moving it arm a a pointer and it camera a an eye. It even used speech to give instruction and play music. However, according to researchers, it will still take many year to build a robot which would make full use of the ""robotiquette"" for human interaction. ""If you think of a robot a a companion for the human being, you can think of 20 year into the future,"" concluded Professor Dautenhahn.

Podcasts mark rise of DIY radio,"An Apple iPod or other digital music player can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more iPod owner are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and it strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ (video jockey) Adam Curry. Podcasting take it name from the Apple iPod, although you do not need an iPod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a PC, and some editing software. They then upload their show to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free. Using technology based on XML computer code and RSS - Really Simple Syndication - listener can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software, which Mr Curry ha pioneered. The latest MP3 file of show can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically. Mr Curry records, hosts, edits and produce a daily, 40 minute podcast called The Daily Source Code. He want to make podcasting ""the Next Big Thing"" and say it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry. ""I wa always into technology and wires,"" he explains. ""My parent gave me the Radio Shack 101 project kit, which allows you to build an AM transmitter and subsequently an FM transmitter. ""I had my mom drive me around the block, see how far it would reach on the car radio."" Mr Curry is American, but he grew up in the Netherlands where he hosted illegal, pirate radio show in the Dutch capital. He tried university in the US, and ended up back in Holland where he hosted a music video show. He spent the next seven year in New York where he worked at MTV hosting the Top 20 Video Countdown, but spent most of his hour tinkering with this new thing called the internet. ""At a certain point in 1995, I wa driving in on a Friday afternoon, beautiful blue sky, one of those beautiful day thinking, this is so stupid. ""You know, I'm going do the Top 20 Countdown, take the cheque, go home, and sit on the internet until three in the morning. ""So, after I finished the show, I quit. I said, on air, it's been great, I've been here for seven year at that point, there's something on the internet, I've got to go find it, and I'll see you later."" But Mr Curry's technology and broadcast interest started to gel a couple of year ago when computer storage wa growing exponentially and high-speed internet connection were becoming more widely available. The MP3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before. Most importantly, Mr Curry says, people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing. ""Listen to 99% of the radio that you hear today, it's radio voices, and it's fake, it's just fake."" He wanted to make it easier for people to find ""real voices"" on the internet. He wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto player like, iPods. Mr Curry is not a computer programmer, so he asked others to create one for him. No one did, so he tried to write one himself. He finished it a few month ago and say it ""totally sucked."" He put it up on the net a open source software and now dozen of coder and audio junky are refining it; the result is a work in progress called ""ipodder"". Doug Kaye, a California-based podcaster, praise the former MTV VJ for what he ha done. ""Adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. Ipodder take audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the MP3 player,"" he explains. ""People can wake up in the morning, pick up their iPods a they go to work or before they go exercise, and discover that there's all this new content automatically put onto their players."" It is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in Australia, Finland, Brazil, even Malaysia. One couple broadcast theirs, The Dawn and Drew Show, from Wisconsin in the US, sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. Topics range from the comfort of their bed, to the latest film or music and have thousand of listeners. Already, website are springing up that point listener in the right direction of good podcasts. Chris McIntyre run Podcast Alley and say that there are good site out there but that not everyone ha the technological know-how to simply listen. ""If I were to tell my mom, or my mother-in-law to copy an XML or RSS file to their podcast aggregator, they would think I wa speaking a foreign language,"" Mr McIntyre says. Along with technical challenges, there may be legal challenge to podcasters who air their favourite, albeit copyrighted, music. Some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see a the ""anti-radio"" into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. Already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. Heineken is doing it own podcast now, and so is Playboy. For his part, Adam Curry's pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. He love doing The Daily Source Code because it is about introducing good music and cool idea to new audiences. He ha even been called the Ed Sullivan or Johnny Carson of podcasting which, he says, ""is a badge I'll wear with great honour. ""To be the Johnny Carson, or Ed Sullivan of anything is wonderful. And you know what? You don't need a hell of a lot of talent. ""You just have to be nice, have your ear open, and let people shine. And that's good for me.""

Christmas sales worst since 1981,"UK retail sale fell in December, failing to meet expectation and making it by some count the worst Christmas since 1981. Retail sale dropped by 1% on the month in December, after a 0.6% rise in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS revised the annual 2004 rate of growth down from the 5.9% estimated in November to 3.2%. A number of retailer have already reported poor figure for December.

Some analyst put a positive gloss on the figures, pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figure showed a performance comparable with 2003. The November-December jump last year wa roughly comparable with recent averages, although some way below the serious boom seen in the 1990s. And figure for retail volume outperformed measure of actual spending, an indication that consumer are looking for bargains, and retailer are cutting their prices.

'No-one can define new hunt ban',"The new law banning hunting with dog is ""so poorly drafted"" no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt MPs say. The accusation came after it emerged a Devon man had been told he could use his four dog to ""chase away unwanted animals"" from his farm. Because he did not intend to kill deer or fox it wa not hunting. Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said minister had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules. North Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw wa put in touch with the Middle Way Group, of which Mr Opik is a co-chairman, after he had been in contact with the rural affair ministry, Defra. He had asked whether his technique of using his four dog to frighten off deer and fox would be outlawed under the Hunting Act. Mr Bradshaw wa initially told it wa an offence - prompting him to complain. The Middle Way group also said Mr Bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animal that would have previously gone free.

""Now Defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting - 'chasing away' which isn't even covered by the Act. ""However, all these activity involve the use of dog to chase wild mammals.

Soaring oil 'hits world economy',"The soaring cost of oil ha hit global economic growth, although world's major economy should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD. In it latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut it growth prediction for the world's main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum. Forecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook wa worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecast slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member country of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. ""There are nonetheless good reason to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,"" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD's chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it wa at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October. A dip in oil price and improving job prospect would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. ""The oil shock is not enormous by historical standard - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price doe not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,"" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report. ""The recovery that wa underway, and ha been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005."" China's booming economy and a ""spectacular comeback"" in Japan - albeit one that ha faltered in recent month - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. ""Supported by strong balance sheet and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,"" it added.

Asylum children to face returns,"The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker child without parent to Albania. The trial scheme, which could start in weeks, may be extended to apply to child from other countries. Children's charity have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amount to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. But the Home Office say it may be in the children's best interest if it reunites them with their communities. The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aim to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking child from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims. Since 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the UK to seek asylum without other family members. These child automatically become the responsibility of social services. Up to now, minister have held back from final removal order against unaccompanied child until after they are legally adult at 18. At least a dozen Albanian-born teenager are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers.

But he said they would insist on government reform and the need for transparency, tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. BBC correspondent Patrick Bartlett said while it wa an agreement in principle, the organisation involved now have to look at how it would work in practice.

Strike threat over pension plans,"Millions of public service worker could strike if minister scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer, warn union leaders. The Cabinet Office ha confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system, prompting union representing 4.5m worker to threaten united action. They believe the plan include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service worker from 60 to 65. The government say union will be consulted before any change are made. It is thought the proposed overhaul, due on Thursday, could mean pension could be based on a ""career average"" salary. For each year served, staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. Ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next May. In a statement on Sunday, the Cabinet Office said it wa reviewing the Civil Service Pension Scheme, and hoped to announce proposal soon. ""Unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes. ""Public sector pension scheme need to remain affordable and sustainable. People are living longer and pension are getting more expensive. ""To maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme, the government announced in it Green Paper on pension that pension age would rise from 60 to 65."" On Monday, Tony Blair's official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. He said: ""What's important is that there's a process going on, it's out for consultation at the moment, let's wait for that process to complete itself."" There is already widespread anger over the chancellor's plan to get rid of more than 100,000 civil servants. Now public service union are united against the plan and the Trades Union Congress is discussing the issue next Monday. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said change to pension provision for worker in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal. ""Members working in the NHS or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses, but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away,"" he said. ""What really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of MPs who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in Europe, but say they can't afford it for anyone else. ""This is a position that Unison cannot accept and will oppose. It will lead to conflict between Unison and the government, if not this year then next."" Mr Prentis said worker did not want to go on strike and called for talk between union and the highest level of government. Mark Serwotka, from the Public and Commercial Services union said there should be a co-ordinated one day strike unless there wa a government rethink.

Brown hits back in Blair rift row,"Gordon Brown ha criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and Tony Blair wa harming the working of government. Jonathan Baume, of the top civil servants' union, spoke of ""competing agendas"" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair. But the chancellor said Mr Baume wa never at meeting between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. He said the union leader wa trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members' jobs. It suited the purpose of Mr Baume's union, the First Division Association, to suggest there were two agenda battling against each other because the union wa trying to resist the planned reforms, Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Under the plans, unveiled in the Gershon report, some 84,000 civil servant job will be axed or changed and the saving ploughed back into frontline services.

He also said that a Mr Baume wa never present at meeting between himself and the prime minister, he wa not in a position to judge. On Wednesday, ahead of the Chancellor's pre-Budget report, Mr Baume told BBC News there were sometimes ""conflicting and competing agenda for government"" between Number 10 and the Treasury. What the chancellor wanted wa ""not by any mean what Alan Milburn and the prime minister want to see"", Mr Baume said. ""Government department get their money from the Treasury on the basis of public service agreement they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also ha an agenda and that's not necessarily the same a the Treasury's and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government.

Solutions to net security fears,"Fake bank e-mails, or phishing, and story about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e-business experts. Trust in online security is falling a a result. Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firm are not doing enough to protect people. The survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. It is worrying for shopaholic and firm who want to exploit the net. More people are becoming aware of online security issue but they have little confidence that company are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm RSA, which carried out the poll. An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net a a way of managing their financial affairs. Security expert say that scare story and the vulnerability dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by bank in particular. ""I don't think the threat is overplayed,"" Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini, told the BBC News website. He added: ""The challenge for bank is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balance that with usability."" Ensuring extra security measure are in place protects them too, a well a the individual, and it is up to both party to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said. ""Card issuer will keep u informed of type of attack and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. If we do that, they will indemnify us,"" he said. Many believe using login detail like usernames and password are simply not good enough anymore though. One of the biggest challenge to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity. Several security company have developed method which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. Last year, a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate. On average, people have to remember four different passwords. Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. Those who use several password often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with password and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of password and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard. Activcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA Security, which ha been trying to come up with just that. RSA ha a deal with internet provider AOL that let people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stay active for 60 seconds. Many company use a token-based method already for employee to access network securely already. Activcard's method is more complex. It is currently trailing it one-time passcode generation technology with UK banks. Steve Ash, from Activcard, told the BBC News website there are two part to the process of identification. The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online. ""The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user know with something they have and present those both."" The method it ha developed make use of the chip embedded in bank card and a special card reader which can generate unique code that are active for a specified amount of time. This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for a little a 30 second before it changes. It combine that with usual usernames and passwords, a well a other security questions. ""You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given. ""If you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction."" The clever bit happens back at the bank's secure servers. The code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key. ""Each individual get a key which is unique to them. It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,"" said Mr Ash. It mean that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode. ""By the time they go back [to use the information], the code ha expired, so they can't prove who they are,"" according to Mr Ash. In the next few years, Mr Ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. ""PCs will have reader built into them, the cost of reader will be very cheap, and more people will have the cards."" The gadget we carry around, like personal digital assistant (PDAs) and mobiles, could also have integrated card reader technology in them.

Man Utd through after Exeter test,"Manchester United avoided an FA Cup upset by edging past Exeter City in their third round replay. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the opener, slipping the ball between Paul Jones' leg after just nine minutes. United wasted a host of chance to make it safe a Jones made some great saves, but Wayne Rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. Exeter had chance of their own, Sean Devine twice volleying wide and Andrew Taylor forcing Tim Howard to save. United bos Sir Alex Ferguson wa taking few chance after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed start to Paul Scholes and Ryan a well a Ronaldo and Rooney. Exeter began brightly with Devine and Steve Flack seeing plenty of the ball, but it did not take United long to assert their authority and the host soon found themselves a goal down. Scholes played a lovely pas in to Ronaldo on the left-hand side of the six-yard box and the Portuguese winger slid the ball between the leg of Jones to open the scoring. United sensed a chance to finish the tie a a contest early on and Ronaldo blazed over before Jones saved well from Scholes and then Rooney. The visitors' pressure by now wa incessant and Rooney had another shot blocked while Ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from a good position. Just before the break Giggs had a golden chance to double the advantage, but the Welshman dragged a left-foot effort badly wide from 10 yards. In stoppage time Exeter created their best chance a Alex Jeannin swung in a cross from the left that Devine managed to flick goalwards, but the ball flew wide of Howard's goal. The Grecians came out after the break in determined fashion and Howard had to show safe hand to collect two searching cross into the United box. Rooney looked like he might have sealed the result with a turn and shot but the ball stuck in the St James Park mud and Jones raced back to gather on the goalline. Moments later Devine had the chance to make himself a hero, but he could only volley Jeannin's brilliant cross wide of Howard's goal after being left unmarked six yard out. After Rooney had completely messed up a free-kick 20 yard out Taylor showed him how it should be done, his stunning drive from distance forcing a flying stop from Howard. The home crowd were baying for a goal and they did get the ball into the net only for Devine's low effort to be ruled out for an obvious offside. The persistent Rooney eventually rounded Jones with three minute to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with Middlesbrough in the fourth round.

Casino Royale is next Bond movie,"Casino Royale, author Ian Fleming's first James Bond book, is to be the next Bond film, with Goldeneye director Martin Campbell behind the camera. It will be the 21st James Bond film to hit the big screen, and speculation ha been rife over who will play the lead.

Feta cheese battle reaches court,"A row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label it cheese feta ha reached the European Court of Justice. The Danish and German government are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole right to use the name. The Commission's decision gave the same legal protection to feta a to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne. But critic of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece. The Commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave ""protected designation of origin"" status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producer there. From 2007 onwards, Greek firm will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producer elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products. The German and Danish government argue that feta doe not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firm have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. ""In our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese,"" Hans Arne Kristiansen, a spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board, told the BBC. Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonne a year - and export it product to Greece. It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheese in Denmark such a brie. ""It would cost million if we wanted to introduce a new designation,"" Mr Kristiansen said. ""That is just one of the costs."" The case will also have a major impact on Britain's sole feta producer, Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses. Judy Bell, the company's founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand it product. ""If we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation,"" she said. ""We have never tried to pull the wool over anyone's eye - it's very clear from the label that it's Yorkshire feta."" The original decision wa a victory for Greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years. Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat's milk, and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine. Greece make 115,000 tonnes, mainly for domestic consumption.

Ireland win eclipses refereeing 'errors',"The International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coach and player from publicly haranguing referee when thing go belly-up. It may have to go the whole way and have NFL-style video camera all over the field, or slap the vociferous perpetrator over the knuckles. What the IRB doe not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging match often overshadow the game itself. Sunday's explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road wa a good example a Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948. The game wa a exciting a it comes, with a much-improved England side enraged at a few decision that did not go their way. One can understand that frustration. There wa no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport's ""blazers"". Referee Jonathan Kaplan wa not perfect by any mean and two decision in particular made him the villain of the piece. I doubt whether Kaplan would have been too pleased at the comment made. After all, he ha no public recourse to criticism. It wa the same for Simon McDowell, the touch judge who wa heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France. As far a England were concerned, there were query over Mark Cueto's first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick. England coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in the Heineken Cup. On that occasion, David Humphreys kicked to Tommy Bowe, who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. But you cannot have camera at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. Perhaps Robinson wa right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey wa driven over the Irish line near the end. Lewsey claim he touched it down and wa in full control. However, one ha to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. But in rugby, everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. The referee also missed England's Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan O'Gara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line. Those were the stand-out moment in a classic game between the two old foes. But there were many more, and one should not take away from those. Brian O'Driscoll's winning try wa a well-conceived a they come, while Charlie Hodgson's brilliant kicking display wa another highlight. And Ronan O'Gara's tremendous ability to control the game wa also a crucial component. But the defining moment came with Ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. Two outstanding piece of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on. The first wa Denis Hickie's brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. He gobbled up Cueto from another Hodgson cross-field kick, then regained his foot to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try. Ireland's second-row colossus Paul O'Connell wa equally superb. England had turned Ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon wa slowly disintegrating. England prop Matt Stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. Unfortunately he ran into O'Connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover.

Lloyd's of London head chides FSA,"The head of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, ha criticised Britain's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority (FSA).

U2's desire to be number one,"U2, who have won three prestigious Grammy Awards for their hit Vertigo, are stubbornly clinging to their status a one of the biggest band in the world. The most popular group in the history of rock all have several thing in common. The music must be inspired and appeal across generation and be distinctive, if not always groundbreaking. But such success is down to more than music. They have to be compelling performers, charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decision and keep their foot on the ground. They also have to want it. They have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. The Beatles had it, the Rolling Stones still have it, REM hold onto it and Queen were it in a catsuit. And U2 have it in spades, and keep churning it out. Their new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, come 28 year after the schoolfriend got together in Dublin and 17 year after The Joshua Tree cemented their place on the all-time rock A-list. They may have lost some of the edginess and raw, youthful force that propelled them to the top, but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft song and albums. Vertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the UK single chart at number one, knocking Eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit. ""The challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make record the whole world will listen to,"" Bono recently said. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr echoed those sentiments: ""We're very competitive - we want to be on the radio, have big singles. We don't want to be thought of a a veteran band."" The band have done ""everything in their considerable powers"" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to Q magazine editor Paul Rees. ""This make them hugely determined and formidable."" He added: ""They are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up. ""As such, they've constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. They are, perhaps, alone a the only rock band that ha got better with age."" The other key ingredient wa the fact they were highly organised, Mr Rees said. ""They do everything in the right way."" The group were born when Mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board, attracting fellow pupil Paul Hewson (Bono, vocals), Adam Clayton (bass), David Evans (The Edge, guitar) and his brother Dick. Dick Evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known a The Feedback and The Hype before settling on U2. By 1978, they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager, Paul McGuinness. ""They were brilliant, but very coarse,"" McGuinness recently said. ""In a way, they were doing exactly what they do now. Only badly."" They struggled to attract record company attention, later being described a ""pretty damn average"" and ""strange and eerie"" by scout who saw them live. They released two Ireland-only singles, which topped the national chart in 1979 and 1980, leading to a deal with Island and their debut album Boy. The stadium-filling, anthemic sound wa U2's aim from the start, and their third album, War, saw them make the breakthrough on both side of the Atlantic, going to number one in the UK and 12 in the US. Songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day brought success and an image a a political and spiritual band - which Bono rejected a a cliche. His stage performance - which included flag-waving, speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation a an electric performer, and their appearance at 1985's Live Aid is widely seen a sealing their global stardom. In 1987, The Joshua Tree broke sale record and saw the band reach the height of their power with hit including Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and With Or Without You. Those song took the band's epic, atmospheric sound to a simple, powerful and popular pinnacle. The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenge and achievements. These came in the form of exploration of different branch of rock and foray into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal. The Achtung Baby album in 1991 wa followed by Zooropa, Pop and their corresponding stadium tours, which featured giant olives, flying cars, live phone call to the White House and Bono's transformation into alter-egos The Fly and MacPhisto. He wa also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - a a campaigner on issue from global debt to Aids.

Federer joins all-time greats,"The last year ha seen one player dominate men's tennis, and one country dominate the women's game. Roger Federer became the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slams in one season. And after Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam at the French Open, two more followed at Wimbledon and the US Open. Meanwhile, Briton Tim Henman enjoyed his best year, while Greg Rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. Federer began the year a world number one and holder of the Wimbledon and Masters Cup titles, and set about conquering new ground. The Swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the Australian Open. He ripped through the draw before beating Marat Safin in the final. Andy Roddick wa the only player to put up any real resistance at Wimbledon, and Federer's performance against Lleyton Hewitt in the US Open final wa breathtaking. Federer again got the better of Hewitt in the season-ending Masters Cup. His victory in Houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final, an Open era record. The only major let-down wa a third-round loss to Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open, and Roland Garros will be his main target in 2005. There wa also a surprise loss to the unheralded Tomas Berdych at the Olympic Games, which saw Chile dominate a Nicoals Massu took the single and then paired up with Fernando Gonzaelz to win double gold. Another major trophy that look beyond Federer is the Davis Cup, which wa won by Spain in a 3-2 home success over the USA in Seville. Roddick struggled on the clay, losing to Rafael Nadal on the opening day before going down to Carlos Moya in the all-important fourth rubber. Henman broke new ground by reaching the semi on clay at the French Open - a stunning effort - and also at the US Open. A quarter-final defeat to Mario Ancic at Wimbledon wa disappointing for the limp manner of the Briton's defeat, but he remains optimistic of going further next year. British number two Rusedski endured a rollercoaster year, returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in March. With his ranking down at 168, many feared the 31-year-old's career wa over, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. The Russian woman finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004, with Myskina, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova winning Grand Slams, before taking the season-ending Fed Cup. But while the young Russians were on the way up, it wa a different story for the Belgians and the Williams sisters. Only veteran Lindsay Davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after Wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of Amelie Mauresmo, whose Grand Slam drought go on. The year started in regulation fashion a Justine Henin-Hardenne beat compatriot Kim Clijsters at the Australian Open. A virus ruined the rest of Henin-Hardenne's year, although she wa fit enough to win Olympic gold, but Clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. She suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with Lleyton Hewitt, and will be happy to see the year end. In their absence, Myskina thrashed Elena Dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all-Russian final at the French Open. Wimbledon wa a more refreshing affair a Sharapova captivated SW19, showing nerve of steel a she battled past Davenport and Serena Williams to take the title. Davenport wa a strong favourite for the US Open but, hampered by injury, lost to the powerful and unflappable Kuznetsova in the semis. Kuznetsova went on to give Dementieva another Grand Slam final thrashing, with the latter's wayward serve becoming one of the talking point of the year. With the Russians still improving, the like of Henin-Hardenne, Clijsters, Davenport, Mauresmo, Venus and Serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005.

Tories attack burglar 'U-turns',"Tory leader Michael Howard ha accused Tony Blair of performing U-turns over rule on using force against burglars. The government ha ruled out amending the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence. Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: ""It is not householder who should be frightened, it's the burglars."" Home Secretary Charles Clarke said minister had kept to their pledge to review the law. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householder using ""grossly disproportionate"" force could be prosecuted. The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted a part of a review of the law. He told MPs: ""If we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law."" Instead, the government ha decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and wa now backtracking again. He said: ""We've had three policy position in three month and two U-turns. ""It's not surprising Gordon Brown told him: 'There's nothing you could say to me now that I could ever believe.'"" Mr Howard said the ""grossly disproportionate"" test matched the hurdle minister had introduced for civil case where burglar where claimed compensation from householders. The issue entered the public spotlight when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin wa jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 a he ran away from the farm. But the home secretary said Mr Howard wa wrong to say the law wa biased in favour of burglars. The barrister who had represented Mr Martin had said the rule were ""weighted overwhelmingly"" in favour of the householder, said Mr Clarke. He said: ""The problem is there ha not been enough understanding of it - that wa the point Sir John Stevens wa making and the prime minister wa making."" The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr Clarke. The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, say only 11 householder or occupier of business premise have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. Those case included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said.

Fed warns of more US rate rises,"The US look set for a continued boost to interest rate in 2005, according to the Federal Reserve.

German music in a 'zombie' state,"The German music business - the third largest in the world - is ""in the state of a zombie"" because it ha failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure ha said. Tim Renner, the head of Universal Music Germany until last year, told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme that the country's music industry wa now struggling to survive. Renner warned that unless the industry accepted ""new realties"" - such a downloading - it decline could become irreversible. ""The problem the music industry ha got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,"" he stated. ""So the music industry in it current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie."" The music market in Germany peaked in 1997, with sale of 2.6bn euro (Â£1.8bn). Since 2000, sale have plummeted to just 1.6bn euro (Â£1.1bn) in 2003. In the space of one year - between 2002 and 2003 - CD album sale fell by 13.8%. But a study by the Society for Consumer Research found that at the same time, more than twice a many recordable CDs had music recorded on them than CD album were sold. Mr Renner pointed out that, because profit come mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record, this wa particularly damaging. ""You need time,"" he added. However, Peter Zombic, the managing director of the International Federation of Phonographic Industry in Germany, said he did not feel the situation wa a ""dramatic"" a Mr Renner believed. ""It's quite true that we have severe problem in Germany - but that's true in other part of the world and in most developed market too,"" he argued. ""We have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. ""I don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful."" He did, however, admit that copyright owner have ""partly lost control of their copyright"", due to piracy and copying. But he refuted suggestion that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. ""We were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,"" he argued. ""At that time it wa not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it wa the Napster time, when P2P service became popular. ""It still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero a far a the illegal product is concerned."" Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem. German law doe allow people to make copy of CDs for their family and close friends, without fear of breaking copyright. Mr Zombic said that this legal framework wa a ""huge problem"".

Roundabout continues nostalgia trip,"The new big-screen version of The Magic Roundabout, released in the UK on Friday, is the latest attempt to turn children's television into box-office gold. Recent year have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show Thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of E Nesbit's Five Children and It, previously filmed by the BBC in 1991. He-Man and Transformers, which were cartoon favourite in the 1980s, will soon receive their own costly makeovers. With screen version of The A-Team, The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blake's Seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business. But some critic complain that these expensive take on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memory of the originals. The new version of The Magic Roundabout, which will be released a Sprung! in the US, replaces the stop-motion model of the 1960s TV show with polished, computer-generated animation. In a similar fashion, the 2004 Thunderbirds used human actor and special effect in place of the original's puppet and models. The film are squarely pitched at younger audiences. Pop star Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue provide voice in The Magic Roundabout, while the now-defunct boy band Busted performed the Thunderbirds theme song. But while some reviewer have been won over, there ha nonetheless been a significant backlash. ""This CG-animated adventure airbrush the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60 stop-motion Roundabout a cult hit,"" writes Stella Papamichael on the BBC Movies site. And the recent puppet comedy Team America: World Police wa in part provoked by it directors' outrage that Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds wa remade without it signature mannequins. Dan Jolin, review editor of Empire magazine, say classic children's TV show have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention. ""I can understand why people are taking these intellectual property and repackaging them for the kid of today. ""But I think it's backfiring. What's next - The Clangers on some distant planet, with some giant CGI Soup Dragons chasing after them?"" Despite Thunderbirds' disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (Â£22m) but only recouped $21m (Â£11m) - the nostalgia craze show no sign of abating. It can therefore be only a matter of time before some other TV favourite receive the Hollywood treatment. After the success of Garfield: The Movie, Britain's shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle. With only 13 episode made of the 1974 series, there is plenty of room to explore the life of the pink cat, Professor Yaffle and the Mice of the Marvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ. Furry recyclers have already had one big-screen outing - 1977's Wombling Free. But with environmental issue still occupying our thought it is high time they made a comeback. Advances in special effect technology could do wonder for the BBC's supernatural comedy . And the success of Pirates of the Caribbean must surely herald a comeback for TV's most popular cartoon buccaneer, . It might also remind viewer the lewd character name often associated with the show never actually existed. The Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 February. How about bringing Catweazle to the big screen? He could give Gandalf a run for his money! Thundercats!! I loved it. Should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back! Get your hand off the Clangers! Is nothing sacred? Make a movie version of the Banana splits! What about Keanu Reeves and Richard Gere in a remake of The Wooden Tops? Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy. You forgot to mention the grearest of them all, Danger Mouse! But then again, it couldn't be better than the original series, could it? It's always nice to see these old toon re-released, but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie (and the song!) I think I've been completely put off. Just leave these classic alone a good memories. I think remake are a good idea. As the world move on people tend to look more and more into the past to thing that make them feel safe. I believe this is the whole reason ""retro"" ha become so popular. As long a a remake doe justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of person to enjoy and revive and old series. Personally i'd like to see cartoon such a Transformers, Thundercats and M.A.S.K. get full Hollywood remakes. Leave them alone, why ruin something that we all have very fond memory of in the first place? The thunderbird film wa apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson. Love to see Transformers with real actor and CGI. And make it at least a 15 rating. Part of the reason for the success of such classic a the Magic Roundabout wa that the character were not the sweet and cuddly creature that you would expect. They were moody, sarcastic, and rather human. Just looking at the picture of the animation for the new film show that these characteristic have not been preserved. Dougal never smiled like that! Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place. I have fond memory of Bod (not least of which because I look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. It's got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. Bod would likely be played by Tom Cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two. It's all very well and good remaking these classic TV show and film with all the latest technology for a 'new' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the original they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these show such a Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation. It doe pose the question though that with all the long line of remake being made, are film-makers running out of original ideas? All I can say is bring back Danger Mouse, probably the greatest kids' show ever. I recently re-watched some episode and realised that there wa a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that wa completely lost on me when I wa a child. There WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of year back. Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original's cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and wa woefully inadequate. We live in a sampling world - the music industry ha been pludering past decade for inspiration, clipping sound from 20 year ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now - it's just cheaper to take idea from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new. It got to be Mr.Benn. The story line about a man who change in a fancy dress shop, step into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. And who to play the lead role? Well if it wa a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve Martin. If it going to be an adventure then Johnny Depp playing a role similar to the Pirates Of The Caribbean Character. Muffin the Mule perhaps ? After all, granny and grandpa go to the cinema a well you know! Why can't the British film industry try making Gerry Anderson's UFO or Captain Scarlet, or Saphire and Steel, or The Tomorrow People. In today's media, it seems the past is the future. TV show such a Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJ's are sampling or re-working 70's and 80's music. Even computer game from 10-15 year ago are getting modern re-workings. Personally, I think it show that no one ha any originality any more! Why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone. Mary, Mungo and Midge. But of course for most of the episode the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. Plus would Mary be more of a Vicky Pollard character a she life in a high rise council block? Yeah but no but I wasn't even there! I'd like to see Mr. Benn, with Brad Pitt in the title role. Sean Connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner. It demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today's film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. There are plany of modern children's book that would make excellent film or TV programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past? Mr. Benn with Rowan Atkinson a the lead. Would have loved to see Dungeons & Dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it wa made into didn't come up to scratch. The only one that isn't to be remade a yet is Thundercats, which I'd like to see. I'm an expat living in Norway, and I recently went through a period of buying the DVDs of many of my favourite children's program for my 2 daughters. My dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen!! Very Scandinavian... Rainbow! I believe that Childrens classic should be left well alone, and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout doe not do well at the Box Office, especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie, popular among child because it's original, witty, and modern. The Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the child of today a it did all those many year ago. How about classic like Chorlton and the Wheelies, Rentaghost, Terrahawks, Bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!! If a Transformers movie is indeed on the card then I'll be the first one on Amazon buying a copy, eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. Repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! I don't care! Till then I'll have to make do with the Citreon C4 advert. I'd luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voice it wouldnt be the same. And who remembers Trap Door voiced by the late Willie Rushden, superb children's programme. Could Morph hold his own in a big screen movie??? Or even Jamie and the Magic Torch....hmmmmm, I could go on and on. Danger Mouse? At 34 I'm showing my age. :-) Noggin the Nog wa one of the best children's programs. The problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach Oliver Postgate's wonderful voices. So in general leave well alone. The original are good because they are of their time and the method used are an integral part of the story. Just imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antic of the bearded hippy, Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like Fingermouse Bob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricks. In the ultimate struggle to save the woman they love from the evil clowns, Krusty and Gobo. Will they triumph or will they fail miserably? Find out this Fall. One puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90. It would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joe's car. Of course, Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen, big-budget action. It wa only that Thunderbirds The Movie wa targetted a a children't movie that really let it down. After all, the child that remember those show with such affection are now the parent of child themselves. It's only because the people who were child when these programme were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods, isn't it? I'd hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation - I love that 'done in a shed' clunkiness and you couldn't recreate the magic. Perhaps if the remake were done in a 'Look Around You' mock-authentic style I might be interested ... Chorton And The Wheelies or Jamie And His Magic Torch; that would be mega! This re-gurgitation of old film and TV show make me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people's ideas, because it guarantee to bring in the $$$. The same can be said of modern day pop band who release other people material, Will Young etc. The sad fact is nostalgia sell big buck in the short-term. The fact that they will be forgotten in 6 month time is irrelevant (e.g. Starsky & Hutch) Hence, the market is saturated with this mindless drivel, but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it! I pray they never do a remake of Chorlton And The Wheelies. I'm only 27 and don't remember the series from when it wa on TV, but have the set on DVD and it's a classic. The fact it's so great come from the fact that there were very few special effect involved and compared to today's stuff it look amateurish.

He-Man and Transformers, which were cartoon favourite in the 1980s, will soon receive their own costly makeovers.

'Debate needed' on donations cap,"A cap on donation to political party should not be introduced yet, the election watchdog ha said. Fears that big donor can buy political favour have sparked call for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission say it is worth debating a Â£10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also say there should be more state funding for political party and candidate should be able to spend more on election campaigning. There were almost Â£68m in reported donation to political party in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly Â£12m of them from individual gift worth more than Â£1m. The rule have already been changed so the public can see who give how much to the party but the report say there are still public suspicions. The commission say capping donation would mean taxpayer giving party more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" say it report. If there wa to be a cap, it should be Â£10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned Â£56m in donation between 2001 and 2003. Even without change the commission doe urge political party to seek out more small-scale donation and suggests there should be income tax relief for gift under Â£200. It also suggests increasing state funding for party to Â£3m so help can be extended to all party with at least two member in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new way of boosting election campaigning, seen a a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidate should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, say the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at election from a national level to a local level to help politician engage better with voters. The report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limit from Â£20m to Â£15m. The commission also say the spending limit for general election should cover the four month before the poll - a happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: ""There is no doubt that political party have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.

Turkey-Iran mobile deal 'at risk',"Turkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry look set to be scrapped after it biggest mobile firm saw it investment there slashed by MPs.

KEY MATCH STATS - BLACKBURN ROVERS against Bolton is part two of an East Lancashire hotpot that didn't turn out to be that spicy when first staged on a Sunday lunchtime the weekend before last, and resulted in a scrappy goalless draw. - Rovers, who are aiming to win the Cup for a seventh time in their history and first time in 77 years, face another replay against Championship opposition after eventually disposing of Cardiff at Ewood Park in the third round. But they've not been beaten in the competition by a club outside the Premiership for nine years, since Ipswich - then in the second tier - defeated them 0-1 after extra time in a third round replay at Ewood Park on 16 January 1996. History is on Rovers side. When they last met their near neighbour in the FA Cup 45 year ago, it also required an Ewood Park replay, which the home side won 2-0, and when they last met in the League, Rovers did the double. They first won their Nationwide Division One trip to Turf Moor 0-2 four season ago, and then thrashed the Clarets on home soil 5-0. - Manager Mark Hughes, who won the Cup four time a a player, is aiming to steer Rovers into the quarter-finals for the second time in 12 years, and first time since the 2000/2001 season. Success here, and victory home to Leicester in the next round, could see Rovers in the semi-finals without having played Premiership opposition. - BURNLEY make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals, determined to send Blackburn the same way a Liverpool in the third round. But having failed to pull off another shock at Turf Moor, it could be that the Championship outfit - 17 place inferior on the League ladder - have missed their best opportunity. Having said that, Burnley are yet to concede a goal in this Cup run. - Steve Cotterills' Clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four time in the last seven years, and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in 21 years. That wa in the season before last, when they disposed of Premiership Fulham at this fifth round stage. - While Blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie, Burnley have had two League outing away from home, drawing 1-1 at Derby and losing 1-0 at Preston.

Apple laptop is 'greatest gadget',"The Apple Powerbook 100 ha been chosen a the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC. The 1991 laptop wa chosen because it wa one of the first ""lightweight"" portable computer and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs. The magazine ha compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving part and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. The magazine specified that gadget also needed to be a ""self-contained apparatus that can be used on it own, not a subset of another device"". ""In general we included only item that were potentially mobile,"" said the magazine. ""In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really make a gadget a gadget,"" it concluded. The oldest ""gadget"" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine date at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place. Other pre-electronic gadget in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia), a well a the first ""successful"" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac). The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13. Sony's third entry in the top 20 is the CDP-101 CD player from 1983. ""Who can forget the crystalline, hiss-free blast of Madonna's Like A Virgin emenating from their first CD player?"" asked the magazine. Karl Elsener's knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list. Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th), 1980s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th). Why worry about mobile phones. Soon they will be subsumed into the PDA's / laptop etc. What about the Marine Chronometer? Completely revolutionised navigation for boat and wa in use for centuries. For it's time, a technological marvel! Sony Net Minidisc! It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. I always used my NetMD, and could not go anywhere without it. A laptop computer is not a gadget! It's a working tool! The Sinclair Executive wa the world's first pocket calculator. I think this should be there a well. How about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or a pocket calculator? All these thing are useful to real people, not just PC magazine editors. Are the people who created this list insane ? Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone? It ha revolutionalised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation system would not have evolved so quickly. Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker?? An interesting list. Of the electronic gadgets, thousand of journalist in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100. The size of A4 paper and light, three week on a set of batteries, an excellent keyboard, a modem. A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible. What's an Apple Powerbook 100 ? It's out of date - not much of a ""gadget"". Surely it ha to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener, Swiss Army Knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch or the thing for taking stone out of horse hoof ? It ha to be the mobile phone. No other single device ha had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time. The ball point pen ha got to be one of the most used and common gadget ever. Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which wa a great improvement over the slide rule. The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noise wa also a hot gadget in 1980. A true gadget, it could be carried around and shown off. All top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. I say this a the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20. Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of it time. The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS. Shame the marketing wa so bad!!! Apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else. Utter rubbish. Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets. But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank them a less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture ha developed. No competition. I'd also put Apple's Newton and the first Palm Pilot there a the front runner for portable computing, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason. I only wish that Vulcan Inc's Flipstart wasn't just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top. How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)? What about radio and TVs? The swiss army knife. By far the most useful gadget. I got mine 12 year ago. Still wearing and using it a lot! It stood the test of time. Psion Organiser series 3, should be up there. Had a usable qwerty keyboard, removable storage, good set of apps and programmable. Case design wa good (batteries in the hinge - a first, I think). Great product innovation. The first mobile PC wa voted best gadget by reader of...err... mobile PC?! Why do you keep putting these obviously biased list on your site? It's obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and reader of a less partisan publication would tell you that. The Motorola Startac should be Number One. Why? There will be mobile phone long after notebook computer and other gadget are either gone or integrated in communication devices. The Psion series 3c! The first most practical way to carry all your info around... I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now. I'd have put the mobile phone high up the list. Probably a Nokia model. Sinclair Spectrum - 16k. It plugged into the tv. Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that's what I do for a living now. I wish more modern notebook -- even Apple's newest offering -- were more like the PB100. Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball, which ha given way to the largely useless ""trackpad"" which every notebook on the market today uses.

Dollar drops on reserves concerns,"The US dollar ha dropped against major currency on concern that central bank may cut the amount of dollar they hold in their foreign reserves. Comments by South Korea's central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines. South Korea, which ha about $200bn in foreign reserves, said it plan instead to boost holding of currency such a the Australian and Canadian dollar. Analysts reckon that other nation may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. At 1300 GMT, the euro wa up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euro per US dollar. The British pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level, while the dollar had fallen by 1.3% against the Japanese yen to trade at 104.16 yen. At the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three month of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery. Analysts, however, pointed to the dollar's inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted the fact that many of the US's economic problem had not disappeared. The focus once again ha been on the country's massive trade and budget deficits, with prediction of more dollar weakness to come. ""The comment from Korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar wa already softening,"" said Ian Gunner, a trader at Mellon Financial.

Terror powers expose 'tyranny',"The Lord Chancellor ha defended government plan to introduce control order to keep foreign and British terrorist suspect under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial. Lord Falconer insists that the proposal do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties. But thriller writer Frederick Forsyth tell BBC News of his personal response to the move. There is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of Britain. Or so say Home Secretary Charles Clarke. My reaction? So what? It is not that I am cynical or just do not care. I care about this country very much. But in the 66 year that I have been alive, there ha not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there ha not been a threat aimed at us. My point is, the British have always coped without becoming a dictatorship. We have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat. But that is what the Blair government now seek to do - create a tyranny to defend u from the al-Qaeda tyranny. I wa born on 25 August, 1938. The mortal threat back then wa a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler. A week after my first birthday, the threat had become reality. We were at war. My father wore a uniform for five years. After 1945 we yearned for peace at last. But in 1946 Winston Churchill told u - from the Baltic to the Adriatic an Iron Curtain ha descended across Europe. Behind the Iron Curtain, another genocidal psychopath, another threat. Josef Stalin triggered the Cold War, with the Berlin blockade in 1948. My whole generation wa blighted by it. We were threatened by the nuclear holocaust, the nuclear wind, the nuclear winter. We built shelter that would have sheltered nothing. We spent our treasure on weapon instead of hospitals. We took silly precautions. Some fought it; some marched futilely against it. Some pretended it wa not there. The Cold War lasted 43 years, but we remained a parliamentary democracy. By the early seventy it wa terrorism a well. Al Fatah, Black September, Red Brigades, but most of all for u the IRA and the INLA. Thirty more years; 300 policeman and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilian dead, but we won because even IRA bomb could not force u to become a tyranny. That wa why the tyrant lost. Civil right were infringed a little a humanly possible. Evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources; yes , and one judge, no-jury court had to be instituted when jury were terrorised. Informants had to be given immunity from their own crime to win the bigger battle. But habeas corpus did not die; right of appeal wa not abolished. Now the threat is Islamic fundamentalism. Its leader want to destroy our society; so did the IRA. It is based and funded abroad; so wa the IRA. It ha sleeper fanatic inside our society; so did the IRA. It is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents; so wa the IRA. The prime mover are not easy to bring to trial; neither were the IRA. But we did. And without becoming a tyranny. Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism. The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister. To be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny. But a tyranny is based on the citizen's terror. This is not victory; this is defeat before a shot is fired. An interesting article - it good to see widening participation in the debate - but I suggest we move one step further. Our own bomb and bullet will can only shatter peace, because invading foreign nations, imprisoning the innocent and 'hunting' in the 'shadows' cannot destroy an evil of the mind, and hatred within the heart. Rather than focusing upon effect, we should consider the cause, because terrorism doe not begin with bombs. Why not try a foreign policy of compassion, it can only enhance our democracy, and share our freedom. I agree with Frederick Forsyth. We really can't deal with terrorism by turning Britain into a fascist state. What we really need is more honesty from our security service and our politicians. If they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any. Our security services, behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty, rake over all kind of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it, while the real villain get away. Remember there were no WMD in Iraq. Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decision in life doe not make them a terrorist. In this overly 'politically correct' society, it is good to see someone like Mr. Forsyth speak out. Yes, there ha been oppression by the British government in the past, and overstepping the mark in place like Ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc. (apart from a number of prisoner in Belmarsh goal, for example).This country sign up to human rights, and then pretend that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?). When ID card become mandatory, the data collected will not be protected by the Data Protection Act, and will be readily available to people like GCHQ, with no control by the person whose ID is being checked. The threat now is new. You cannot compare the threat of past year with now. Forsyth say 3000 died over 30 year or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in NY on September 11th 2001. The threat today is that terrorist will acquire nuclear or biological technology. A Kilo of Semtex will flatten a building, a Kilo of plutonium will flatten a city. You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist act with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible. I agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too. The problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no. However, a the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the right of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far. As somebody of Chinese origin, I can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life. Whilst life wasn't perfect, we could make better for ourselves. Now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do. We have to be politically-correct and we are not allowed to have belief or opinions. We have a Prime Minister who spends too much time meddling in US politics and affair which have little to do with the life of British Citizens at home or abroad. Mr Forsyth ha done a good job in voicing his opinions. Let's hope the BBC doesn't get gagged for letting people express their views. The people have the right to know and the BBC's role is to Inform, Educate and Entertain... I agree. Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which ha spread the fear, by it constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our right and liberties. In the end, the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy. The terrorist have already won. I absolutely agree with Frederick Forsyth. Yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing law seem to be more than adequate. The idea that the ""new terrorism"" demand new power is erroneous. The evidence of any real terrorist capability in the UK is scant. Ricin, for example, is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction. What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reaction and attempt to manipulate the electorate through fear. If the government ha it way with ID cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism ha won and a such it then matter little whether we give in to the terrorist demand or not. We will have lost the precious freedom which Bush and Blair constantly tell u we have and that they seek to bring to others. I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth. I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberty that British people have enjoyed for century - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court. That go right back to Magna Carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against government who thought they ""knew best"". When you look at today's Britain, you realise George Orwell wa only wrong about one thing: the date. Frederick Forsyth put it beautifully. The government is seeking to introduce a police state. The new power of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID card and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years. We are sleep-walking into this. Wake up! An interesting view but missing two crucial fact of this new threat: 1) If these terrorist acquire weapon of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance. These people will use devastating force against u without fear of ANY consequence. 2) The terrorist are prepared to use suicide bomber which mean they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it. Because these terrorist are potentially SO deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses. It will be a little late in the day when people outside London wake up one morning to find out that London ha been nuked. We won't have much of a society left to debate ! He's correct in most of what he says. Mind you he doe seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in Northern Ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young Catholics to join the IRA. Administrative detention of Muslims could have a similar effect now. Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?)They were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack. I don't usually have much time for Mr Forsyth's largely right wing view but this time he ha got it spot on. There is no doubt that there are terrorist organisation who would like to do harm to the U.K. but it is very doubtful whether al-Qaeda is a global organisation co-ordinating this. The rise of surveillance cameras, ID cards, the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times, this is the stuff of nightmares. Add to this this new legislation which effectively mean that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the Home Secretary, and I genuinely wonder what sort of world my two child will inherit. Where will this end. As it stand terrorist do not need to attack the U.K. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs. Mr Forsyth ha expressed exactly what my gut fear and reservation were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise. Thank you. Mr Forsyth seems to forget that killing in the Troubles occurred on both side of the religious divide and wa carried out by killer from both sides. He also forgets basic Human Rights were suspended then a now. Experienced Judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriage of justice during those times. For very little return and maximum alienation. These law and the emphasis on the Islamic threat will just do the same. Forsyth is wrong. The nature of the current threat is new. It is no longer to our armed forces, a the Soviet threat in the Eastern bloc was. It is to you and I. The terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately. The best comparison is therefore the blitz, 1941. At this time, let u not forget, suspect (foreign and British were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaint from the public. We must not forget we are at war. I'd say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatic against a major UK target is a ""When"" not an ""If"" probability. I'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the UK. People like Forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite New Labour and Tony Blair. I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth. The very reason this country ha been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government. The perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorist are doing, but from our own government. I believe what this government is doing, is, at the very least, highly questionable and at worst, sinister. At what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the British Isles; when we are all tagged and monitored constantly? Our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing. It should be of great concern to everyone. I am slightly older than Mr Forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history a him. I am against a police state and would not like to think that I lived in one. I think that the attack on Iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further act of terrorism. How true. There are extremely worrying parallel between Britain now and Germany during the 30's. I never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within. Mr Forsyth ha forgotten one key point; the terrorist who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler, Stalin, and the IRA all failed. As a result modern day terrorist are willing to do thing their predecessor did not. That doe not mean that the civil liberty of modern Britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort. But to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do thing a little differently. Let u hope not. Frederic Forsythe's comment seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society a a whole, and Britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear. It is this fear which enables terrorist to succeed in the end, and terrorist can come in all forms, a Mr. Forsythe's opening comment suggest. I am reminded of a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson. ""A nation that limit freedom in the name of security will have neither."" The government are faced with an incredibly difficult task, and have made a policy to deal with it. It's all very well criticising that policy, but if Mr Forsythe can't draw on his year of experience to offer an alternative, I say 'So what?' to his opinions. Frederick Forsyth's rhetoric is absurd and his conclusion laughable. He distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against New Labour. This government seek to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights. It is Frederick Forsyth who is the extremist, because he doe not appreciate the need for balance. I rarely find myself agreeing with My Forsyth, but in this instance I think he is correct. The rule of law must prevail, civil liberty are worth defending. If the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next? I agree absolutely. By introducing fascist type law we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror. Our democratic system is not perfect, but a Churchill point out it is ""better than all the others that have been tried"". Terrorist attack will take place but for many reason we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom. I do not usually agree with Mr. Forsyth, but he is spot on here. The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit it own purpose. Totalitarianism always requires an outside threat, justifying a range of extraordinary power leader want. The British government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation. Although, in principle I agree with him, Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point- al-Qaeda attack (though obviously there have been none yet in the UK) seek to kill the maximum number of people. The IRA wanted to limit the death toll of their attack so a to maintain support among the republican movement. Yes, I agree with Mr. Forsyth's views. I do not believe the government's plan are justified. There is over reaction to and the negative influence of the US President's interpretation of democracy and freedom. He us the same argument that were current before the WWII, the Wars to ""liberate"" Iraq, Afghanistan with Syria and Iran to come. We are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations. Mr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs. The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests. Sadly comment such a his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrant instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little Austrian.' Thomas Hobbes would be smiling in his grave at Labour's propositions. Like New Labour, he called himself a libertarian. Like New Labour, he believed he wa promoting the people's best interests. But a Forsythe criticises this government, Hobbes ha been criticised by most subsequent philosopher for arguing his way into the hand of the totalitarians. Simply put, he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty - the liberty to live - man should be prepared to surrender all other liberty to a supreme sovereign, a protection against his fellow, barbaric, man. Hobbes ha been roundly condemned by posterity, and rightly so. I hope New Labour suffers the same treatment. I agree with Mr Forsyth's views. The government approach is totally against the spirit of British democracy. They must not be allowed to get away with it. Of course Frederick is wrong about Britain winning the war against the IRA and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny. Has he forgotten about shoot to kill, torture, internment without trial, collusion with loyalist death squad etc? My background is somewhat similar to Freddie's so I am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments. We can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizen of basic individual and collective freedoms. Whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorist under house arrest might seem superficially attractive, it is, unfortunately, also the first step towards totalitarianism. Who is to decide whom is a suspect? Why should we believe them? Who can have faith in the honesty, integrity, and competence of our intelligence service and politician in light of the event of recent years? What is to stop false denunciations? What of those falsely accused who will lose their careers? Who will support their families? Will their child still go to school? It smack to me of the method of Nazi Germany, Stalin's Russia, Ceausescu's Romania - the list go on. It look a if a new dark age is coming. I see that opinion on Mr Forsyth's remark are divided. The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of. But history ha shown that if you have law like that, they always get abused by those in power. After all, today you may be scared of the same people a those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you! And that day, you'll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice. Our law are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces, you have to be shown to be deserving of it. If we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting. I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one. We, a a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro US propaganda, which of course also mean we'll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods. I grieve for the future of my children, it's no wonder they're adamant they don't ever want any of their own. This government, with much fanfare, sign u up to the European Convention on Human Rights but now want to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial. This put it on a par with the government of Burma. Like many of your respondents, I wouldn't usually think of Mr Forsyth a someone whose view I share, but in the instance of opposing Charles Clark's proposal for house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth/ I agree with Mr Forsyth. Just look at the fact - our government (along with the US) invaded another sovereign country (Iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear. The fact turned out to be very different. If individual are treated in the same distorted way, then we've done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs. We become animal too. I agree in many way with what Mr Forsyth ha said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk a well a talking the talk - how can we accuse country such a Zimbabwe and Burma of human right abuse when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order. Mr Forsyth link ""Islamic fundamentalism"" to the new ""threat"". However it appears that he ha misunderstood the term ""Islamic fundamentalism"". It should be pointed out that a Muslim who adheres to the true fundamental of the Qur'aan and the teaching of the last Prophet Muhammad is an Islamic Fundamentalist. This person doe not commit suicide in any shape or form, nor doe she/he kill innocent women, men and children. This person is self-reflective and constantly try to better her/his action by being good to others. The people who Mr Forsyth label the new ""threat"" are those who do not follow the correct teaching of Islam. They have arrived at their own interpretation and assumption with regard their actions. On top of that, they claim to be following Islam in it true form! I accept that the intention of these policy are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing ha ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombing didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved wa to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republican willing to take up arm against the British. Being eight year older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on. During the IRA bombing there were massive explosion in Canary Wharf, to the right of where I write this, and also to the left in the City of London. Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempt on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupant of 10 Downing Street, there wa no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin a there ha been on Afghanistan and Iraq. Even when England wa in true peril in 1940 apart from some detention there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like. We have to see off these latest attempt on our liberty including ID cards, which Winston Churchill decided had to go since, he said, the average Bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activity (incidentally I can still remember my old ID card number). Hence it is clear that the far too great police state power set for the statute book have to be resisted and neutered. What can I add to Mr. Forsyth's eloquently put arguments... except applause! Well done that man for standing up and being counted in the ""war against tyranny"".",politics,"Mr Forsyth links ""Islamic fundamentalism"" to the new ""threat"".The people who Mr Forsyth labels the new ""threat"" are those who do not follow the correct teachings of Islam.Mr Forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler, Stalin, and the IRA all failed.The British government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.The perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists are doing, but from our own government.Like many of your respondents, I wouldn't usually think of Mr Forsyth as someone whose views I share, but in the instance of opposing Charles Clark's proposals for house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth/  I agree with Mr Forsyth.The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests.I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth.Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little Austrian.'I do not usually agree with Mr. Forsyth, but he is spot on here.An interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.The threat now is new.I agree with Frederick Forsyth.As it stands terrorists do not need to attack the U.K. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order.Mr Forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions.The Lord Chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and British terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial.If the government has its way with ID cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.People like Forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite New Labour and Tony Blair.I agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.We have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat.I absolutely agree with Frederick Forsyth.Although, in principle I agree with him, Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point- al-Qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the UK) seek to kill the maximum number of people.Yes, there has been oppression by the British government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like Ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.In this overly 'politically correct' society, it is good to see someone like Mr. Forsyth speak out.Mr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise.I'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the UK.I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.It is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end, and terrorists can come in all forms, as Mr. Forsythe's opening comments suggest.The very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government.This government, with much fanfare, signs us up to the European Convention on Human Rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.To be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny.2) The terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it.The threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology.What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of.I agree with Mr Forsyth's views.I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.The nature of the current threat is new.But in the 66 years that I have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us.Yes, I agree with Mr. Forsyth's views.But to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently.Of course Frederick is wrong about Britain winning the war against the IRA and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.Being eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on.)They were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.It will be a little late in the day when people outside London wake up one morning to find out that London has been nuked.Forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in NY on September 11th 2001.But that is what the Blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-Qaeda tyranny.I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one.I am slightly older than Mr Forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him.These laws and the emphasis on the Islamic threat will just do the same.Forsyth is wrong.If the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next?That does not mean that the civil liberties of modern Britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort.The government is seeking to introduce a police state.That goes right back to Magna Carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they ""knew best"".Mr Forsyth seems to forget that killings in the Troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides.Like New Labour, he believed he was promoting the people's best interests.Just look at the facts - our government (along with the US) invaded another sovereign country (Iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear.These people will use devastating force against us without fear of ANY consequence.Frederick Forsyth puts it beautifully.Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.The mortal threat back then was a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler.Mr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs.The governments approach is totally against the spirit of British democracy.I am against a police state and would not like to think that I lived in one.But history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power.The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.Now the threat is Islamic fundamentalism.I don't usually have much time for Mr Forsyth's largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.It is Frederick Forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance.This government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.The problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no.The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister.Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism.At this time, let us not forget, suspects (foreign and British were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public.The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.If we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting.Because these terrorists are potentially SO deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses.The idea that the ""new terrorism"" demands new powers is erroneous.You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible.However, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far.It is based and funded abroad; so was the IRA.This puts it on a par with the government of Burma.Thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even IRA bombs could not force us to become a tyranny.The terrorists have already won.Like New Labour, he called himself a libertarian.(apart from a number of prisoners in Belmarsh goal, for example).This country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?).Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?And without becoming a tyranny.When you look at today's Britain, you realise George Orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.But as Forsythe criticises this government, Hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.It has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the IRA.Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.You cannot compare the threats of past years with now.Our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing.I agree.If they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any.Lord Falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.",0.08262189417621357,"The Lord Chancellor ha defended government plan to introduce control order to keep foreign and British terrorist suspect under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial.

Ministers lose slopping out case,"The Scottish Executive ha lost an appeal against an inmate's compensation for being forced to slop out in prison. Armed robber Robert Napier, 25, won Â£2,450 after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint, eczema, when slopping out at Barlinnie Prison. Napier said that the practice, where prisoner use bucket in their cell a toilets, breached his human rights. On Thursday, the Court of Session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof. The executive face more than 1,000 similar claim for damage from prisoner and former inmates. More than 310 action have already been raised in the Court of Session and sheriff court in Scotland. An executive spokesman said: ""We will study this judgement in detail. Much ha changed to address the issue raised in the Napier case, for example, slopping out ha ended at Barlinnie and work in other prison is being accelerated. ""Today's judgement doe not affect the outcome of other cases."" Napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the European Convention on Human Rights, in which he sought Â£5,000. He wa awarded compensation last April after winning his case. Executive minister raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in case alleging a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should ""be beyond reasonable doubt"". This is the standard normally applied in criminal trial in Scotland. However, civil litigation is settled on the test of ""a balance of probabilities"". Judge Lord Cullen, sitting with Lord Osborne and Lord Hamilton, ruled that alleged human right breach involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard. Napier's lawyer Tony Kelly belief the action will soon be followed by others. Mr Kelly said: ""There are hundred of people still undergoing slopping out, overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by today's judgement."" Scottish National Party Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill said that the slopping out case had been ""a fiasco from start to finish"". He said: ""Ministers were fully aware of the state of Scotland's jails. Funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling I suspect we will be faced with even more claim and no doubt more payouts.

'Nuclear dumpsite' plan attacked,"Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded ""deeply irresponsible"" by the Liberal Democrats. The government ha confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that wa to have been shipped back to it home country will now be stored in the UK. The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused minister of turning Britain into a ""nuclear dumpsite"". Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none ha ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to it country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from country such a Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a ""sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipment to overseas countries"". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to it home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity. Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to Â£680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. But the move ha been criticised by environmental group and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: ""I have been warning for month that this would happen and raised it with government several times. But now our worst fear have been confirmed.

Remote control rifle range debuts,"Soon you could go hunting via the net. A Texas company is considering letting web user use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs. For a small fee user will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animal a they roam around a 133-hectare Texas ranch. The Live-Shot website behind the scheme already let people practise shooting at target via the internet. John Underwood, the man behind the Live-Shot website, said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he wa watching deer via a webcam on another net site. ""We were looking at a beautiful white-tail buck and my friend said 'If you just had a gun for that'. A little light bulb went off in my head,"" Mr Underwood told the Reuters news agency. A year's work and $10,000 ha resulted in a remote-controlled rig on which sits a camera and .22 calibre rifle. Mr Underwood is planning to put one of these rig in a concealed location in a small reserve on his Texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals. Also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunter can quickly track and aim at passing game animal with the camera and rifle rig. Each remote hunting session will cost $150 with additional fee for meat processing and taxidermy work. Species that can be shot will include barbary, Corsican and mouflon sheep, blackbuck antelope and wild pigs. Already the Live-Shot site let people shoot 10 round at paper and silhouette target for $5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session. For further fees, user can get the target they shot and a DVD recording of their session. Handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off-range or at something it should not be. Mr Underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunter unable to get out in the wood or distant hunter who cannot afford a trip to Texas. In a statement the RSPCA said it had ""grave concerns"" about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle. ""We assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a 'clean kill', something the RSPCA accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport,"" it said. ""Animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily,"" said the statement. Mike Berger, wildlife director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, said current hunting statute did not cover net or remote hunting. He said state law on hunting only covered ""regulated animals"" such a native deer and bird species.

Big war games battle it out,"The arrival of new title in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchise leaf fan of wartime battle title spoilt for choice. The acclaimed PC title Call of Duty ha been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements. For it part, the long-running Medal of Honor series ha added Pacific Assault to it PC catalogue, adapting the console game Rising Sun. Call of Duty: Finest Hour cast you a a succession of allied soldier fighting on World War 2 battlefront including Russia and North Africa. It is a traditional first-person-viewed game that let you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohort constantly bark order at you. On a near-identical note, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault doe all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action. Its arena are the war's Pacific battles, including Guadalcanal and Pearl Harbour. You play one character throughout, a raw and rather talkative US soldier. Both game rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keep thing ticking along. When this works, it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story. When it doe not, it is tedious. A winning moment is an early scene in Pacific Assault, where you come under attack at the famous US base in Hawaii. You are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming wave of Japanese planes, then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman, before seizing the anti-aircraft guns. It is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game. This notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moment of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic. The genius of something like Half Life 2 is that it skilfully disguise it linear plotting by various mean of misdirection. This pair of game do not really accomplish that, being more concerned with imparting a full-on atmospheric experience. Call of Duty come with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation. Finest Hour ha a similar determination, framing everything in moody wartime music, archive footage and lot of reflective voice-overs. Letting you play a number of different role is an interesting ploy that add new dimension to the Call of Duty endeavour, even if it sacrifice the narrative flow somewhat. The game's drawback could be said to be it format; taste differ, but these wartime shooter often do seem to work better on PC. The mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphic a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that PC game are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety. Call of Duty on PC wa more detailed, plot-wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feel a little rough and ready. Targeting with the PS2 controller proved tricky, not helped by unconvincing collision-detection. You can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question a to your aim, yet the bullet will just refuse to hit him. Checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot, which happens regularly, you are set harshly far back, and will find yourself covering vast tract of scorched earth again and again. The game want to be a challenge, and is, and many player will like it for that. It is a dynamic a battlefield simulator a you will experience and even if it is not a refined a it PC parent, the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive. Both of these game feature military colleague who are disturbingly bad shot and prone to odd behaviour. And in Pacific Assault in particular, their command and comment are irritatingly meaningless. But the teamwork element in title like this is superficial, designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanic at all. Of the two games, Pacific Assault get more thing right, including little point like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation. It engages you very well and also look wonderful, making the most of the lush tropical setting that are reminiscent of the glorious Far Cry, although we had to ramp up the setting on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them. Finest Hour is by no mean bad, and it is only because the PC original wa so dazzling that this version sometimes feel underwhelming. Those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemy to shoot will be contented. But they will also have a niggling puzzlement a to why it doe not break a little more ground rather then just being competent.",tech,"For its part, the long-running Medal of Honor series has added Pacific Assault to its PC catalogue, adapting the console game Rising Sun.On a near-identical note, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action.Call of Duty on PC was more detailed, plot-wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready.Of the two games, Pacific Assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation.The acclaimed PC title Call of Duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements.The game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that.Those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented.It is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game.Finest Hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the PC original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming.The mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that PC games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety.The arrival of new titles in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.Call of Duty: Finest Hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on World War 2 battlefronts including Russia and North Africa.It is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you.Both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along.This notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic.",0.08883470456746317,"The arrival of new title in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchise has made the long-running Medal of Honor series ha been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements.

New York rockers top talent poll,"New York electro-rock group The Bravery have come top of the BBC News website's Sound of 2005 poll to find the music scene's most promising new act. The Bravery, who have been compared to The Cure and New Order, were the most heavily-tipped act in the survey of 110 impartial critic and broadcasters. Rock band Keane won Sound of 2004 while US rapper 50 Cent topped Sound of 2003. Other new artist in this year's list include London indie group Bloc Party at second and UK rapper Kano third. The Bravery played their first gig in 2003 and have since supported band including The Libertines, Interpol and Echo and the Bunnymen. They were the subject of a record company bidding war in 2004 and their debut single, Unconditional, caused a huge buzz when it wa released in the UK in November. Singer Sam Endicott said he felt ""great"" about coming top of the Sound of 2005 list. ""Anyone that say they don't want a zillion screaming fan is a jackass, a liar,"" he said. One of the expert to tip The Bravery wa The Times' music critic Paul Connolly, who said they were ""spiky but in love with pop"". Chris Hawkins, host of BBC 6 Music's chart show, said the band had ""great guitar and a mastery of the electro-clash sound"". ""The Bravery are proof alone that New York City is still home to hot new talent,"" he said. Nigel Harding, head of music at London rock radio station Xfm, said every track from their live set ""sounded like a potential single"". Unconditional reached the summit of the station's listeners' chart within a fortnight of it first play, which Mr Harding described a ""an unheard of achievement for a debut single"". Q magazine review editor Ted Kessler said they were ""pretty-boy New York clothes horses"" with ""an unusually nimble ear for concise, yearning pop in the mould of Duran Duran or The Strokes"". Other pundit to take part in the survey included BBC Radio 1 DJ Trevor Nelson, NME editor Conor McNicholas, Top of the Pops presenter Fearne Cotton, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis and BBC Radio 2 music editor Colin Martin.

US rapper The Game is hip-hop great Dr Dre's latest protege while Leeds group Kaiser Chiefs came fifth with a promise to lead a Britpop revival. In last year's survey, Keane were followed by Franz Ferdinand, Razorlight and Joss Stone in the top five - all of whom were virtually unknown outside the music industry at that point. Boy band McFly were sixth while Scissor Sisters, who had the UK's best-selling album of 2004, were seventh. In the survey, the pundit were asked for tip for three act they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre, either in term of sale or critical acclaim. The artist could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such a a soap actor.

Parry puts Gerrard 'above money',"Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMT. But Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who ha been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future. He told BBC Five Live: ""Steven is above money. He is the future of Liverpool. ""It doesn't matter if it's Â£30m, Â£40m or Â£50m, we will not accept offers. But we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep Steven against his will."" On the subject of Liverpool's finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for it proposed new stadium. And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talk on new investment are ongoing, but added the door ha not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Parry joined Liverpool a chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League. There have been several high and low during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard. On the subject of Liverpool's captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid did ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiation for striker Fernando Morientes. He said: ""They were looking for way of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid wa the same - Steven is not for sale."" But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: ""I sincerely hope he will be. Steven know my views. He know Rafa's views. ""We have re-affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him. We crave success a much a he does. We know he's ambitious and nobody can argue with that. ""I think Steven would dearly love to win thing with Liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else. ""We all want to see progress by next season. He's not alone in that. There are a lot of other player who feel the same, so we all have a common aim."" It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a Â£30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claim he will be in no mood to listen. ""There have been a lot of open secret about Steven, most of which have been complete myths. It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. We didn't had an offer last summer,"" Parry explained. ""We had told Chelsea that a far a we were concerned he wa not for sale and we didn't want to sell him. In reality it didn't go beyond that. ""Maybe there will be an offer in the summer. Maybe there won't. ""Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he ha enough respect for u - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. ""You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will. That just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offer for Steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda. You can forget that."" Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpool's new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007. And he confessed Arsenal's Â£100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming right - ha given the Anfield club serious food for thought. He said: ""I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record a saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener. ""I would say in the past deal have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. ""But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that cause you to draw breath and say 'wow - that's interesting.' ""My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium."" Some Liverpool fan would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: ""I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. ""If it wa the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell. ""I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibility of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to. ""That's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore."" On the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiation with a mystery investor, with rumour of interest from the Middle East. That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bid and what he claimed wa indecision by the board. He also accused Liverpool of using him a ""a stalking horse"" to attract other bids, but Parry explained: ""Steve ha never been used a a stalking horse. There's no need, and that is not the way we do business. ""We had discussion with Steve over the course of 2004. I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen. ""Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and a I have said it wa of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. We are still evaluating it. ""Steve's interest wa taken very much on it own merits. His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who know what the next few month will hold? ""The door isn't closed on anything. We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year. ""We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful. That's a dream we all share, so a far a I'm concerned the door is not closed."" I would take Â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it get u cash what difference doe it make really? Â£50m for Gerrard? I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard's quality. Through a cleverly worded statement, the club ha effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do. Critical time for Liverpool with regard to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash. Â£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard's transfer for any fee over Â£35m. Parry's statement are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed a a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry. I would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. The key is if Gerrard come out and say that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.",sport,"I would keep Gerrard.But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: ""I sincerely hope he will be.""I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else.Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: ""I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team.On the subject of Liverpool's finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.But Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future.Steven knows my views.I think it would be remiss not to.But we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep Steven against his will.""We didn't had an offer last summer,"" Parry explained.I would take Â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.On the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East.He said: ""They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale.""Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term.""You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will.There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.""Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial.Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a Â£30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.Â£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it.I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.That just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda.And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen.Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell.""I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating.Â£50m for Gerrard?He told BBC Five Live: ""Steven is above money.He is the future of Liverpool.""We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him.",0.12645922133422136,"Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMT.

Bridge could miss rest of season,"Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle. The England international, 24, wa hurt in an innocuous challenge with Alan Shearer during the Londoners' FA Cup defeat at Newcastle on Sunday. ""We think it's a big injury,"" said Jose Mourinho, whose Chelsea team this week meet Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool in the Carling Cup final. William Gallas and Damien Duff could also miss the Barcelona game. France defender Gallas and Ireland winger Duff both picked up their injury in the closing stage of Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at St James' Park. With Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knock plus Carlo Cudicini's red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. Cudicini would not have played against Barcelona, but had been promised a game in the Carling Cup final, although he will now miss the Cardiff showpiece through suspension. The manager is not planning to add any new name to his squad ahead of the trip to Barcelona, even though he ha few option to replace Bridge at left-back. Celestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas ha deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself. It could be that Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with Glen Johnson, who ended the Newcastle game in goal, playing on the right. Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be option should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie. Bridge's injury also mean Mourinho, who reportedly want to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season. ""He (Bridge) ha no chance of playing against Barcelona, probably will not play against Liverpool (in the Carling Cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season,"" he said. ""The medical department will try to do everything to recover Gallas and Duff. We will have to wait and see, but I won't cry about injury because we will have 11 player to play on Tuesday."" Shearer said he wa unsure what caused Bridge's injury. ""I don't know what happened."" he said. ""It wa just a shame. I don't think we even touched each other. ""By all account it's pretty serious.

Mr Peston told BBC News: ""My understanding is that they are not nearly a close or a friendly a they once were. ""What the book say is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity.

Film production 'falls' 40% in UK,"The number of British film produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004, with movie starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law among those affected, Screen Daily ha said. Twenty-seven British film were made in the UK last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. It attributed the drop to tighter tax law and reduced funding from source such a the National Lottery. UK and US co-productions in Britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year. Last year the government closed tax loophole that many film investor had taken advantage of to fund film in the UK. Several project were shelved a they faced the implication of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional source including the lottery and Miramax Films.

A speech on mobile TV by Angel Gambino of the BBC also drew a large crowd, suggesting that even those mobile operator and equipment vendor which are not particularly active in mobile TV yet are starting to look into it. But all is not simple and straightforward in the mobile TV arena. There is a battle for supremacy between two competing standards: DVB-H for Digital Video Broadcasting for Handsets and DMB for Digital Multimedia Broadcasting. Dr Chan Yeob Yeun, vice president and research fellow in charge of mobile TV at LG Electronics, said: ""DMB offer twice the number of frame a minute a DVB-H and doe not drain mobile battery a quickly."" The Japanese, Koreans and Ericsson of Sweden are backing DMB. Samsung of South Korea ha a DMB phone too that will be one of those offered to user of the TU Media satellite mobile TV service to be launched in Korea in May. Nokia, by contrast, is backing DVB-H, and is involved in mobile TV trial that use it art-deco style medium phone, which ha a larger than usual screen for TV or visual radio (a way of accompanying a radio programme with related text and pictures). Mobile operator O2 and Vodafone are among the operator trialling mobile TV. But even if the standard battle is resolved, there is the thorny issue of broadcasting rights. Ms Gambino say the BBC now negotiates mobile right when it is negotiating content. For those not convinced mobile user will want to watch TV on their handsets, Digital Audio Broadcasting may provide a good compromise and better sound quality than conventional radio. Developments in this area are continuing. At a DAB conference in Cannes, several maker of DAB chip for mobile announced smaller, lower- cost chip which consume less power. Among the chip company present were Frontier Silicon and Radioscape. The jury is still out on whether TV and digital radio on mobile will make much money for anyone.

Tobacco giants hail court ruling,"US tobacco company have welcomed an appeal court's decision to reject the government's $280bn (Â£155bn) claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers. Tobacco stock rose sharply on Wall Street after the 2-1 decision. The court in Washington found the case - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Anti-smoking group urge the government to fight on, but the Justice Department ha not said if it will appeal. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. They were delighted by the decision, which sent Reynolds share up 4.5% and Altria share up 5.11%. Charles A Blixt, executive vice-president of RJ Reynolds Tobacco, said the ruling ""dramatically transforms"" the government's lawsuit. Altria Group said, in a statement, the government now ""must not only prove that the company have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past, but that they are likely to do so in the future."" The government had claimed tobacco firm - manipulated nicotine level to increase addiction - targeted teenager with multi-billion dollar advertising campaign - lied about the danger of smoking and ignored research to the contrary. Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firm to ""disgorge"" $280bn in profit accumulated over the past 50 year and impose tougher rule on marketing their products. They brought the case under racketeering laws, which were passed to deny mafia gang the profit of their crimes. But the tobacco company denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. They also said they had already met many of the government's demand in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 state in 1998. The three-judge panel in the District of Columbia's Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that the US government could not sue the firm under the anti-racketeering laws. Judge David Sentelle, in his ruling, said such law were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward. ""We hold that the language of (the law) and the comprehensive remedial scheme of (the law) preclude disgorgement a a possible remedy in this case,"" he wrote. The Justice Department refused to say if it would appeal. ""All we're saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it,"" a spokeswoman said on Friday. But William Corr of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids urged the government to continue pressing it case.

Lib Dems highlight problem debt,"People vulnerable to problem debt should be afforded greater protection from bank aggressively promoting financial products, the Lib Dems say. Vincent Cable say one in eight household already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rate or unemployment.

India seeks to boost construction,"India ha cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in it construction sector. Kamal Nath, Commerce and Industry Minister, announced the decision in Delhi on Thursday following a cabinet meeting. Analysts say improving India's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sector too. The Indian government's decision ha spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some Indian firms. A spokesman for DLF Builders, Dr Vancheshwar, told the BBC this will mean ""better offerings"" for consumer a well a builders. He said the firm will benefit from world class ""strategic partnerships, design expertise and technology, while consumer will have better choice."" The government proposal state that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on project including housing, hotels, resorts, hospital and educational establishments. The automatic route mean that construction company need only get one set of official approval and do not need to gain clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which can be bureaucratic. The government hope it new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries. Mr Nath also announced plan to allow foreign investor to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. ""Foreign investor can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, township or commercial premise but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meter (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,"" said Mr Nath, without specifying the timeframe. Previously foreign investor had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the Indian market. This measure is designed to discourage foreign investor from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. Anshuman Magazine, managing director, of CB Richard Ellis - an international real estate company - told the BBC this wa ""a big positive step."" However, Chittabrata Majumdar, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said allowing FDI in the country is compromising India's own ""self reliance"". He said, ""No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.""

Rings of steel combat net attacks,"Gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals. Many extortionist are targeting net-based betting firm and threatening to cripple their website with deluge of data unless a ransom is paid. But now deep defence are being put in place by some of the UK's biggest net firm to stop these attacks. Increasing number of attack and the huge amount of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firm to adopt the measures. ""Net firm are realising that it's not just about anti-virus and firewalls,"" said Paul King, chief security architect at Cisco. ""There are more thing that can be done in the network to protect data centres."" Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attack wa with intelligent net-based systems. Many of the gambling site suffering DDoS attack are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more site than just the one the criminal were targeting, said Mr King. This overspill effect wa only likely to grow a attack grow in size and scale. Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common type of attack hit site with 10 megabyte of data over short period of time. Bigger attack sending down 200 megabyte of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said. ""It doe feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing,"" he said. So far there have been no attack involving gigabyte of data, said Mr Seagrave. However, he added that it wa only a matter of time before such large attack were mounted. Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attack were at their height, customer were getting hit every four to five days. The defence being put in place constantly monitor the stream of data flowing across network and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. ""It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,"" she said. ""We study the profile of their traffic and a soon a we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boy to see if we are going to sustain an attack,"" said Ms Capella. This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attack typically use thousand of computer in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood. Typically these computer have been infected by a virus or worm which report it success and the net address of compromised machine back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. Hijacked computer are known a zombie or 'bots and collection of them are called 'bot nets. Many spammer rent out 'bot net to help them anonymously send junk mail. Most of the zombie are based outside the country that host the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult. Often Pipex and other net supplier do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. ""The serious player tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,"" said Ms Capella. ""We ask, a part of the service we provide, that customer notify u of anything they have in advance that would give u forewarning."" Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware take over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that site stay up. Energis took a similar approach, said Mr Seagrave. ""We have technology out there that allows u to detect attack in minute rather than let network engineer spend hour pulling the information together,"" said Mr Seagrave. Also net firm were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attack and pool information about where they are coming from. Information gathered on attack and where they originated ha led to some arrests. He said Energis also did it own intelligence work to get in insight into which site criminal gang plan to target. ""We have people in place where they shouldn't be, monitoring tech sites,"" he said. Sometimes though, he said, spotting the next victim wa easy. ""You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another,"" said Mr Seagrave.",tech,"So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave.Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King.""It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,"" she said.Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time.Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up.Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said.Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days.""We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,"" said Mr Seagrave.Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems.""The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,"" said Ms Capella.""We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,"" said Ms Capella.""You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another,"" said Mr Seagrave.This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from.",0.08673552754435106,"Gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals.

Mobile games come of age,"The BBC News website take a look at how game on mobile phone are maturing. A brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the review by clicking on the link below. If you think of Snake when some mention ""mobile games"" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. This is because mobile game have come a long way in a very short time. Even before Nokia's N-Gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operator were realising that there wa an audience looking for something to play on their handset. And given that many more people own handset than own portable game playing gadget such a the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market. That audience includes commuter wanting something to fill their time on the way home, game fan looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. Life for all these type of player ha got immeasurably better in the last year a the number of title you can download to your phone ha snowballed. Now site such a Wireless Gaming Review list more than 200 different title for some UK network and the range suit every possible taste. There are port of PC and arcade classic such a Space Invaders, Lunar Lander and Bejewelled. There are also version of titles, such a Colin McRae Rally, that you typically find on PCs and consoles. There are shoot-em-ups, adventure games, strategy title and many novel game only found on handsets. Rarely now doe an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. Increasingly such launch are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up million of downloads. The return can be pretty good when you consider that some game cost Â£5. What ha also helped game on mobile thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known a Wap push. By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. Far better than having to navigate through the menu of most mobile operator portals. The number of handset that can play game ha grown hugely too. Almost half of all phone now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated game that are available - even the one that use 3D graphics. The minimum technology specification that phone should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which mean that game are too. Now double key press are possible making familiar tactic such a moving and strafing a real option. The processing power on handset mean that physic on mobile game is getting more convincing and the graphic are improving too. Some game maker are also starting to take advantage of the extra capability in a mobile. Many titles, particularly racing games, let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. Usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ""ghost"" or ""shadow"" to see if you can beat them. A few game also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via Bluetooth short-range radio technology. With so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening.

Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed a the palm tree and cactus whip by and the city scroll past in the background. The car handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it wa not clear if the different model of car were appreciably different on the track. The only niggle wa that the interface wa a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play.

Graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only help to make clear what is going on and level are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. Both background music and sound effect work well. The scenario are well scripted and you regularly get hint from the Fatal Force commanders. Weapons include flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenade and at a couple of point you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. With the right power-up you can go into a Matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. The game let you play via Bluetooth if others are in range.

Mobile networks seek turbo boost,"Third-generation mobile (3G) network need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. That wa one of the message from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week. Fast 3G network are here but the focus ha shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, say the Global Mobile Suppliers Association. At 3GSM, Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 time faster than current 3G networks. The system is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operator on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. Early HSDPA system typically offer around two megabit per second (Mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobit per second (Kbps) on standard 3G networks. ""High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) - sometimes called Super 3G - will be vital for profitable service like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,"" according to a report published by UK-based research consultancy Analysys. A number of company are developing the technology. Nokia and Canada-based wireless communication product company Sierra Wireless recently agreed to work together on High Speed Downlink Packet Access. The two company aim to jointly market the HSDPA solution to global network operator customers. ""While HSDPA theoretically enables data rate up to a maximum of 14Mbps, practical throughput will be lower than this in wide-area networks,"" said Dr Alastair Brydon, author of the Analysys report: Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements. ""The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic WCDMA [3G],"" he added. Motorola ha conducted five trial of it technology and say speed of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device. But some mobile operator are opting for a technology called Evolution, Data Optimised (EV-DO). US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to it 3G network at the end of last year. We are ""expanding our network and deploying EV-DO technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds,"" said Oliver Valente, Sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract wa announced. As part of $3bn in multi-year contract announced late last year, Sprint will spend around $1bn on EV-DO technology from Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speed of 0.3-0.5 megabit a second, and peak download rate of 2.4Mbps. MMO2, the UK-based operator with service in the UK, Ireland and Germany, ha opted for technology based on the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) standard. Using technology from Lucent, it will offer data speed of 3.6Mbps from next summer on it Isle of Man 3G network, and will eventually support speed of up to 14.4Mbps. US operator Cingular Wireless is also adopting HSDPA, using technology from Lucent alongside equipment from Siemens and Ericsson. Siemens' plan for a one gigabit network may be more than a user need today, but Christoph Caselitz, president of the mobile network division at the firm say that: ""By the time the next generation of mobile communication debut in 2015, the need for transmission capacity for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10."" Siemens - in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology - ha souped up mobile communication by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. This enables a data transmission, such a sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flow of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. The speed offered by3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operator were paying huge sum for 3G licences. But today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband network that offer speed of 0.5 megabit a second - must faster than 3G. This mean user are likely to find 3G disappointing unless the network are souped up. If they aren't, those lucrative ""power users"", such a computer geek and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenue available to mobile operators. But one gigabit a second system will not be available immediately. Siemens say that though the system work in the laboratory, it still ha to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae device and conduct field trials. A commercial system could be a far away a 2012, though Siemens did not rule out an earlier date.",tech,"The system is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now.Using technology from Lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6Mbps from next summer on its Isle of Man 3G network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4Mbps.At 3GSM, Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data.But some mobile operators are opting for a technology called Evolution, Data Optimised (EV-DO).The speeds offered by3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3G licences.The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3G networks.Siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but Christoph Caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: ""By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10.""Siemens - in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one.Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device.Fast 3G networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the Global Mobile Suppliers Association.""High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) - sometimes called Super 3G - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,"" according to a report published by UK-based research consultancy Analysys.US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3G network at the end of last year.MMO2, the UK-based operator with services in the UK, Ireland and Germany, has opted for technology based on the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) standard.",0.040855892933357715,"Third-generation mobile (3G) network need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services.

Ukraine revisits state sell-offs,"Ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousand of business by the previous administration. The new President, Viktor Yushchenko, ha said a ""limited"" list of company is being drawn up. But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government wa planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. The government say many privatised firm were sold to ally of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. More than 90,000 business in all, from massive corporation to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, a the command economy built up when Ukraine wa part of the Soviet Union wa dismantled. Ms Tymoshenko said prosecutor had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 business which were to be reviewed. ""We will return to the state that which wa illegally put into private hands."" A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investor - had said only 30 to 40 top firm would be targeted. The list ""will be limited and final, and will not be extended after it completion"", he said. An open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit. But the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in Russia, Mr Hensel said. As a result, it wa planning to resell rather than keep firm in state hands. ""They're aware of the need not to scare investors, and to be careful of internal divide within Ukraine,"" he said. ""They don't want to be seen to be transferring asset from one set of oligarch to a new set."" Foreign investment in Ukraine, at about $40 a head in 2004, is one of the lowest among ex-Soviet states. Mr Yushchenko became president after two election in December, the first of which wa annulled amid allegation of voting irregularity and massive street protests. His opponent, Viktor Yanukovich, still ha huge support in the country's eastern industrial heartland. Mr Yushchenko's administration ha accused it predecessor, led by ex-President Leonid Kuchma, of corruption. The privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma's son-in-law, for $800m (Â£424m) despite higher bid from several foreign groups. The mill, Krivorizhstal, is one of the world's most profitable. ""We say Krivorizhstal wa stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,"" Mr Yushchenko told an investors' conference in Kiev. One of the jilted bidders, Netherlands-based group LNM, said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market. ""If the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued, then we would look at it with great interest,"" a spokesman told BBC News. A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Mr Hensel. But he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owner the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale. ""That way, Mr Yushchenko can go to the public and say he ha forced the oligarch to play by the rules,"" he told BBC News.",business,"The new President, Viktor Yushchenko, has said a ""limited"" list of companies is being drawn up.""We say Krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,"" Mr Yushchenko told an investors' conference in Kiev.An open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit.But the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in Russia, Mr Hensel said.A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted.But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms.""That way, Mr Yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules,"" he told BBC News.Ms Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed.The list ""will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion"", he said.The privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma's son-in-law, for $800m (Â£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups.A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Mr Hensel.",0.10886740071522681,"Ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousand of business by the previous administration.

Blogger grounded by her airline,"A US airline attendant is fighting for her job after she wa suspended over posting on her blog, or online diary. Queen of the Sky, otherwise known a Ellen Simonetti, evolved into an anonymous semi-fictional account of life in the sky. But after she posted picture of herself in uniform, Delta Airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay. Ms Simonetti wa told her suspension wa a result of ""inappropriate"" images. Delta Airlines declined to comment. ""I wa really shocked, I had no warning,"" Ms Simonetti told BBC News Online. ""I never thought I would get in trouble because of the blog. I thought if they had a problem, someone would have said something before taking action."" The issue ha highlighted concern amongst the growing blogging community about conflict of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites. Ms Simonetti wa suspended on 25 September pending an investigation and ha since lodged a complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). A spokesperson for Delta Airlines told BBC News Online: ""All I can tell you is we do not discus internal employee issue with the media."" She added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal website had occurred in the past. Ms Simonetti started her personal blog in January to help her get over her mother's death. She had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for, and created fictional name for city and companies. The airline's name wa changed to Anonymous Airline and the city in which she wa based wa called Quirksville. A large part of the blog contained fictional story because Queen of the Sky developed over the month a a character in her own right, according to Ms Simonetti. The image were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother. ""We often take picture on flight or on layovers. I just though why not include them on my blog for fun. ""I never meant it a something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them,"" Ms Simonetti said. She ha also claimed that picture of male Delta Airline employee in uniform are freely available on the web. Of the 10 or so image on the site, only one showed Ms Simonetti's flight ""wings"". ""They did not tell me which picture they had a problem with. I am just assuming it wa the one of me posing on seat where my skirt rode up,"" she said.

Wales make two changes for France,"Wales coach Mike Ruddock ha made two change from the team that beat Italy 38-8 for Saturday's trip to France. Kevin Morgan take over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing. And in the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones is preferred at blindside flanker to Jonathan Thomas. Thomas, a try-scorer in Rome, drop down to the bench instead of Ian Gough, while Cardiff back Rhys Williams step up in place of Morgan. Luscombe is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the Six Nations game against Italy last weekend. However, the experienced and in-form Morgan wa already pushing hard for a start at Stade de France. ""Due to his impressive performance from the bench, Kevin wa very much in the selection mix anyway, and the unfortunate injury to Hal give him the chance to start,"" said Ruddock. ""Now that Ryan Jones ha recovered from injury, we have increased the option in the back row. ""Jonathan Thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against Italy and scoring a try, but such is the competition for place that every position is debated in detail. ""For this particular game, we felt we might not always be afforded the open space out wide we were able to exploit against Italy, so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion. ""Obviously, it's a 22-man game these days, and there is every chance that Jonathan will be making an impact from the bench."" Wales have beaten France on two of their last three visit to Paris, and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first Five or Six Nations title triumph since 1994. ""Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of year ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he wa proved right,"" said Ruddock.

Student 'fee factor' played down,"A rise ha been recorded in the number of student from south of the border applying to university in Scotland. However, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish student missing out. Applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. Fears had been expressed that a flood of ""fee refugees"" would try to avoid top-up fee of up to Â£3,000 a year being introduced in England. In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposal to increase tuition fee for English student studying in Scotland by Â£2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure ha yet been agreed. Legislation to introduce the top-up fee in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and student who start before then will not have to pay additional fee at all. The figure were made public on Thursday by admission service Ucas. Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in application did not amount to Scottish student being squeezed out. Director, David Caldwell, said some student could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fee at English universities, but this wa not a major factor. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""The reason people are opting for Scottish university is that they are perceived a being of very high quality, they offer very attractive course and Scotland is seen a a very attractive place to study. ""They know that when they take up their study in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fee if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the number coming to Scotland are so inflated. ""However, it doe not mean that we will see thousand of additional student from England studying here."" Mr Wallace agreed and said the figure had to be looked at in context. He explained that when application were translated into acceptances, the number wa not huge - an additional figure of about 200. Also, the picture wa further blurred by the fact that application from Wales, where there are no plan for top-up fees, have also risen, by 19%. Mr Wallace said: ""Accepting student from all part of the world doe show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain. ""We want to make sure that when student are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland. ""We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish student to get place at Scottish university because we are seen a the cheap option.

Costin aims for comeback in 2006,"Jamie Costin should be paralysed. He say so himself in a matter-of-fact way a he recall the car accident which occurred nine day before he wa scheduled to step out into the Olympic Stadium in Athens for the 50K Walk. There is an ironic chuckle a he talk of his immediate thought after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. ""I wa in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toe wa broken,"" say the Waterford man. ""But I wa thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. ""In my back, it felt a though all the muscle had been ripped off my pelvis but I wa thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race."" It took over 10 hour before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. ""My back had been broken in two place and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. ""I'd fractured my big toe a well which wa on the brake."" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hour after the accident. ""For the first nine hours, I had no pain killer which wa ridiculous in 35 degree heat. ""But once I got the scan and saw them it wa a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstance now'."" Within three day he wa arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. ""The Greek doctor were going to put three or four inch titanium rod either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. ""That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. ""But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it wa possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic."" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half month after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back. He then progressed to crutch for six week until he wa finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. ""Walking without the crutch seemed like something finally really measurable in term of my recovery."" Physio session with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. ""Johnston us an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. ""Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today a a result."" Jamie ha also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he ha trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. ""I wa there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. ""Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degree centigrade and it promotes deep healing."" Jamie head to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio session and pool-work. All these session are small step on the way to what Jamie hope will be a return to racing in 2006. ""It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half month didn't really help with the strength. ""There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hour a day between physio and pool work. ""I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weight to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. ""I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. ""At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up.

UKIP candidate suspended in probe,"Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.

Child access laws shake-up,"Parents who refuse to allow former partner contact with their child could be electronically tagged under plan being considered by ministers. Curfews and community service order were other option which could be used if court order to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affair secretary outlined some of the plan on Tuesday. He denied fathers' activist had forced the changes, telling the BBC ""there is a recognition that something is wrong"". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couple go to court to resolve access dispute each year, although in nine out of 10 separation there is no court intervention. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve dispute before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plan include: - Parenting plan to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life example that have worked in the past - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearing before contested court case - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet - Legal aid change to give incentive for early resolution of disputes. Judges can already jail parent who breach contact order but that wa a ""nuclear option"" which wa rarely used a it wa not seen a being in the child's interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation wa to provide a ""medium range"" of penalties, such a fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting class or curfews. Failure to comply with these measure could result in offender being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: ""Tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that."" Full detail of the new power will not be revealed until a bill is published ""in the next two weeks,"" a spokesman said. The government's proposal have met with disapproval from fathers' right groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: ""It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation."" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposal ""lacked compulsion"". ""We would like to see couple develop a plan and then have it a a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. ""Otherwise, you see people make agreement which then fall apart."" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children's Minister Margaret Hodge there wa not enough time to pas the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May. The Conservatives have called for an equal split between parent on access to be made law.

Who do you think you are?,"The real danger is not what happens to your data a it cross the net, argues analyst Bill Thompson. It is what happens when it arrives at the other end. The Financial Services Authority ha warned bank and other financial institution that member of criminal gang may be applying for job which give them access to confidential customer data. The fear is not that they will steal money from our bank account but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities. Armed with the personal detail that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name. And it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statement and demand for payment start arriving. Identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime, and we are all becoming more aware of the danger of leaving bills, receipt and bank statement unshredded in our rubbish. But, however careful you may be, if the organisation you trust with your personal data, bank account and credit card are not able to look after their database properly then you are in trouble. It is surprising that it ha taken the gang so long to realise that a well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system. In fact, I suspect that the FSA is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing ha been going on for rather a long time. Has anyone checked Bob Cratchit's family link to the criminal underworld, I wonder? And it is hardly likely to be only bank that are being targeted. Health authorities, government agency and of course the big e-commerce site like Amazon must also offer rich picking for the fraudsters. The good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account detail that they are not supposed to. And a we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transaction on our statements, bank should have good enough record and log to trace the people who might have accessed the account details. Fortunately there are now way to keep bank system more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files. Companies like SecureWave, for example, can restrict the use of USB port just to authorised device or even to an individual's personal memory card. These solution are not perfect, but it doe not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system. However the warning doe highlight one of the major issue with e-commerce and online trading - the security or otherwise of the server and other system that make up the 'back office'. It ha been clear for year that the real danger in paying for good online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked. In fact I do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment detail ha led to card fraud. There are simply too many e-mail passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud. CD Universe, Powergen and many other company have left their database open and suffered the consequences. And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that it customer account detail could be read by anyone who could guess a login name. Whether it is external hacker breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get a part of their job, the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused? Any organisation that process personal data is, of course, bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it. Unauthorised disclosure is not allowed, but the penalty are small and the process of prosecuting under the Act so convoluted a to be worthless in practice. This is not something we can just leave it to the market. The consequence of having one's identity stolen are too serious, and market respond too slowly. After all, I bank with Cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my account that I did not even consider it when I heard about their security problems. I doubt many others have closed their accounts, especially when there is little guarantee that other bank are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future. The two option would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that company really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuit against financial institution with sloppy practice whose customer suffer from identity theft. I have never felt comfortable with the US practice of suing everything that moves, partly because it seems to make lawyer richer than their clients, so I know which I'd prefer.

Dundee Utd 4-1 Aberdeen,"Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen. Alan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minute and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minute later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yard before half time. The scoring wa completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal wa called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort wa gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the foot of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minute when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minute later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter wa met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless. United restored their two-goal lead four minute before the end of a highly entertaining first half.

Italy to get economic action plan,"Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plan aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome. He will present an ""Action Plan for the Development of Italy"" in a meeting with industrialist and trade union leaders. Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reform aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. Also in focus will be bankruptcy law and the slow pace of the legal system. The prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 GMT. The government ha been accused of underfunding R&D, making it harder for Italy to compete with other European nation and leading to a ""brain-drain"" of the country's brightest talents. Analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. As a result, they say, Italy's corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller company that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. At the same time, bankruptcy law make it difficult for failed company director to set up new business and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy's entrepreneurial spirit. The government say that it ha set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going wa the responsibility of all of Italy's 60 million population. According to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's business newspaper, the government will focus on ""opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentive available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system"". Mr Berlusconi ha previously promised to cut tax by 6.5bn euro ($8.6bn; Â£4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and company to spend. He ha also promised to cap spending on transport, education and health so a to trim the ballooning budget deficit. Italy plan to raise a much a 25bn euro from privatisation in 2005, including a partial flotation of the post office and utility Enel. Critics argue that these move do not go far enough and could make Italy's problem worse. Limiting government spending will lead to job losses, they counter, while the income tax cut will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy. The country ha been one of the eurozone's worst economic performer in recent years. Growth wa 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. At the same time, business and consumer confidence ha dipped and analyst have raised concern that what little spending there is stem from Italians dipping into their saving account or using credit cards.

The court is currently selecting 12 juror and eight stand-by juror for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the star's legal team wa hit by family illness. Defence lawyer argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisation to have potential jurors' response made public.

Blair blasts Tory spending plans,"Tony Blair ha launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a ""ludicrous improbability"". The prime minister ha told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policy would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard ha said his party would cut Â£35bn in ""wasteful"" spending to allow Â£4bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cut by removing ""inefficiencies"" which had ""burgeoned"" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: ""The Conservative tax and spending proposal would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decade - and the key investment in public services. ""I believe that the Tory plan are a plain a call to return to the past a it's possible to imagine,"" he said. ""It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cut in public service that were their hallmark in 18 year of Conservative government."" Mr Blair added: ""They, the Conservatives have learned nothing."" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to it electorate and changed. Mr Blair went on to list his government's achievement and to issue a rallying call to the party. ""So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight."" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such a removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officer and match Labour's spending on health and education. ""Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lot of stealth tactics, lot of increase in taxes, but no improvement in public services,"" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for ""huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy"". ""The public face a choice between more waste and more tax with this government, less waste and lower tax with a Tory government,"" he concluded. Gordon Brown ha addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plan would see some Â£50bn in spending cut by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the danger of allowing themselves to be ""distracted or diverted"". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: ""We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decision necessary to meet them."" Mr Brown warned that the Tories were planning ""the biggest cut ever in the history of any election manifesto"". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of ""misrepresenting"" the party's proposal and questioned how Labour would fund it own plans. ""He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matter to people - schools, hospital and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,"" Mr Letwin said.

MPs to debate 'euthanasia laws',"MPs are preparing to debate a bill which critic claim would legalise euthanasia ""by the back door"". The bill would give legal force to ""living wills"", where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. The Mental Capacity Bill ha broad support from charity who say it would give better safeguard over treatment. But Christian group say it could mean doctor withholding food and fluid even if they think it inappropriate. Ministers insist the Mental Capacity Bill - for England and Wales - would not change law on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life. The bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decision about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. It would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decision on their behalf, which could be challenged by doctors. Critics fear it could allow ""killing by omission"" through withdrawing treatment. An amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decision that would bring about death - ha been tabled by former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. Ninety one MPs have signed a petition backing the amendment. MPs could vote on it later on Tuesday, during the bill's report stage debate. The Bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the Lords, before becoming law. The Christian Medical Fellowship (CMF) and Lawyers' Christian Fellowship (LCF) said the Mental Capacity Bill would allow euthanasia by the ""back door"". Peter Saunders of the CMF said it believed advance refusal should be only advisory, not legally binding. ""CMF is concerned that patient will make unwise and hasty advance decision to refuse food and fluid without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take,"" he said. The LCF's Andrea Williams said there were ""too many loophole that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors"". Ex-Labour minister Frank Field told BBC Two's Newsnight programme there wa a danger people would feel under pressure to ""do away"" with themselves so relative could inherit their assets.

Mr Lammy told BBC News Labour MPs would not get a free vote a the law wa being strengthened, not changed. ""We are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living will and that ha the force of the common law,"" he said. ""Doctors are saying they want more clarity. Patients are saying they want more clarity."" The Making Decisions Alliance, which includes the Alzheimer's Society, Age Concern, Mencap and the National Autistic Society, said misunderstanding over the bill had to be cleared up. ""It will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguard when decision are made for people who lack capacity,"" the alliance said in a statement. The British Medical Association also back the bill, saying it just give incapacitated people the same right a others.

China 'to overtake US net use',"The Chinese net-using population look set to exceed that of the US in less than three years, say a report. China's net user number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country's 1.3 billion people. Market analyst Panlogic predicts that net user in China will exceed the 137 million US user of the net by 2008. The report say that the country's culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different end than in many other nations. Already net use in China ha a very different character than in many Western nations, said William Makower, chief executive of Panlogic. In many Western nation desktop computer that can access the net are hard to escape at work. By contrast in China workplace machine are relatively rare. This, combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it take to get phone line installed, help to explains the huge number of net cafe in China. Only 36% of Chinese home have telephone according to reports. ""Net usage tends to happen in the evening,"" said Mr Makower, ""they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;."" ""Its fundamentally different usage to what we have here,"" he said. Net use in China wa still very much an urban phenomenon with most user living on the country's eastern seaboard or in it three biggest cities. The net is key to helping Chinese people keep in touch with friends, said Mr Makower. Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friend at net cafes. What people can do on the net is also limited by aspect of Chinese life. For instance, said Mr Makower, credit card are rare in China partly because of fear people have about getting in to debt. ""The most popular way to pay is Cash-On-Delivery,"" he said, ""and that's quite a brake to the development of e-commerce."" The arrival of foreign bank in China, due in 2006, could mean greater use of credit card but for the moment they are rare, said Mr Makower. But if Chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it give them on Western way of living. ""A large part of the attraction of the internet is that it go below the radar,"" he said. ""Generally it's more difficult for the government to be able to control it."" ""Its real value is a an open window onto what's happening elsewhere in the world,"" he said. Government restriction on how much advertising can appear on television mean that the net is a source of many commercial message Chinese people would not see anywhere else. Familiarity with the net also ha a certain social cachet.

The Force is strong in Battlefront,"The warm reception that ha greeted Star Wars: Battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in it gameplay, but of it back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient. Geared towards online gamers, it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights, set in an array of location all featured in, or hinted at during, the two blockbusting film trilogies. Previous Star Wars title like the acclaimed Knights Of The Old Republic and Jedi Knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative foray into the far corner of the franchise's extensive universe, and their use of weird and wonderful new characters. Battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable element of the hit movie themselves. The sights, sound and protagonist on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans, who may well feel that the opportunity to relive Star Wars' most memorable screen skirmish make this the game they have always waited for. The mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first-person perspective, and you can either fight for the force of freedom or join Darth Vader on the Dark Side, depending on the episode and type of campaign a well a the player's personal propensity for good or evil. There is ample chance to be a Wookie, shoot Ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired-up Luke Skywalker. In each section, the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops, seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet. It really is no more complicated than that. Locations include the frozen waste of Hoth, the ice planet from The Empire Strikes Back, complete with massive mechanical AT-ATs on the march. There are also the dusty, sinister desert of Tatooine and Geonosis, a well a the forest moon of Endor, where Return Of The Jedi's much-maligned Ewoks lived. The feel of those place is well and truly captured, with both backdrop and character looking good and very authentic. It is worth noting though that on the PlayStation 2, the game's graphic are a curiously long way behind those of the Xbox version. The pivotal element behind Battlefront's success is that it successfully give you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war. The number of combatants, noise and abundance of laser fire see to that, and the sense of chaos really come over. Speaking of noise, Battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the Star Wars galaxy's audio motifs. The multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noise are immensely familiar, a are the stirring John Williams symphony that never let up. There is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his theme in the menu section. It ha to be said if the game did not have the boon of being Star Wars, it would not stand up for long. The gameplay is reliable, bog-standard stuff, short on originality. There are also odd annoyances, like the game's insistence on re-spawning you mile away from the action, an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear. And some of the weapon and vehicle are not a responsive and fluid to operate a they might be. That said, it is still great fun to pilot a Scout Walker or Speeder Bike, however non user-friendly they prove. Whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind, Battlefront is actually perfectly good fun a an offline game.

Brown targets OAPs and homebuyers,"Gordon Brown ha doubled the level at which house buyer pay stamp duty to Â£120,000 a he put the economy at the heart of Labour's election campaign. The chancellor also unveiled a one-off Â£200 council tax refund for pensioner and a rise in child tax credit. Mr Brown put 1p a pint on beer, 4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarette but froze petrol duty until September. The Tories called it a ""vote now, pay later"" Budget. The Lib Dems branded it a ""sticking plaster"" for the election. Tory leader Michael Howard predicted the Budget would do nothing to help Labour's ""faltering"" election campaign. ""This government and this chancellor have run out of solution to the problem Britain faces,"" Mr Howard told MPs. ""Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."" He ended his response with an election challenge to Labour, saying ""bring it on"". Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy attacked Mr Brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice. ""How can it be right in Britain today that the poorest 20% pay more in tax, a a proportion of their income, than the richest 20%?"" he asked. Mr Kennedy criticised Mr Brown for failing to mention the ""ticking bomb"" of council tax revaluation, saying it wa ""high time"" the system wa replaced by a ""local tax based on the ability to pay"". During his 49 minute speech Mr Brown told MPs he had defied the pundit by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004. He said his Budget struck a balance ""between tax cut that are affordable, investment that are essential and stability that is paramount"". He rejected across-the-board tax cut in favour of targeted help for families. The child tax credit will rise in line with earnings, giving family an extra Â£5 a week. In contrast, the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from Â£4,745 to Â£4,895 next month. Mr Brown told MPs child benefit would rise to a maximum of Â£63 a week for the first child and Â£111 for two children. Despite his giveaways, Budget document show Mr Brown clawed back Â£265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. He also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged area - a measure brought in just over three year ago. BBC political editor Andrew Marr suggested the sweetener were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters. But trust in Mr Brown's economic stewardship would be a central election issue, he said. Mr Brown also unveiled plan for a memorial to the Queen Mother, funded through a special coin to celebrate the Queen's 80th birthday. Other measure include equal tax status for same-sex couple and a deal with the Council of Mortgage Lenders to boost low cost home ownership. The level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from Â£263,000 to Â£275,000 from April. Mr Brown said he had met his financial ""golden rule"" with a Â£6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years. The economy had grown for 50 consecutive quarters, he said, and wa forecast to continue doing so over the next year, with a forecast of 3% to 3.5% in 2005 and 2.5% to 3% in 2006. The first Â£2bn of value-for-money saving identified in the Gershon Review have been achieved, the chancellor said. Some 12,500 civil servant post have been axed, and 7,800 relocated out of the south east of England, he added.

The ""clear message"" the report sends is that effective use of ICT can bring real improvement in business performance for all business.

Gamers could drive high-definition,"TV, films, and game have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens. It is called high-definition - HD for short - and it is already hugely popular in Japan and the US. It is set, according to analysts, to do for image what CDs did for sound. Different equipment able to receive HD signal is needed though and is expensive. But Europe's gamers may be the early adopter to drive demand. Europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream HDTV. To view it, it need to be transmitted in HD format, and people need special receiver and display that can handle the high-quality resolution. The next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. And most new computer display and plasma set are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. ""In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,"" Dr Mark Tuffy game system director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website. ""Every game is going to be playable in HD. ""So consumer who have gone out and spent all this money on HDTVs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. ""It's going to change really the way they look at gaming."" At the end of last year, Chris Deering, Sony's European president, made a prediction that 20 million European household would have HDTV set by 2008. A previous prediction from analyst Datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 set at the end of 2003. But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about Â£2,000 - if there are few programme or film to watch on them. Satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV service in 2006 and the BBC intends to produce all of it content in HD by 2010. Until broadcast rights, format standard - and the practicality of updating equipment - are agreed, TV content will be limited. All TV image are made up of pixel which go across the screen, and scan line which go down the screen. Most standard UK TV picture are made up of 625 line and about 700 pixels. HD offer up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. This mean the picture is up to six time a sharp a standard TV. ""Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, a in 'look what this TV can do', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,"" explains Dr Tuffy. But gamers are also the ideal target audience for HD because they always crave better quality graphics, and more immersive gaming experiences. They are used to spending money on hardware to match a game's requirements. Demographics have changed too and the ""sweet spot"" for the game industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. This mean they are likely to have higher disposable income and can afford the price of big-screen, high-definition display technology and HD projectors, earlier than others. Higher capacity storage discs, such a HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of game console - allowing developer more room for detailed graphics. For console developer though, HD offer some production changes. It could make game production slightly more expensive, think Dr Tuffy. ""But we may see the cross-platform development of game becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console,"" he says. ""You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD. ""And the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game, just now they have almost got it seamless."" With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality a the big-screen cinema release. This could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. But it may not be until the generation after the next game console where the two industry really collide. At that point, say Dr Tuffy, game could become more or less interactive movies.",tech,"""Every game is going to be playable in HD.""Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this TV can do', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,"" explains Dr Tuffy.But it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide.""In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,"" Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website.""But we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console,"" he says.Higher capacity storage discs, such as HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.TV, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.HD offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels.It could make games production slightly more expensive, thinks Dr Tuffy.For console developers though, HD offers some production changes.Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels.At that point, says Dr Tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release.Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive.""You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD.",0.01584134534715931,"TV, films, and game have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.

Blair pledges unity to Labour MPs,"Tony Blair ha sought to reassure Labour backbencher that nothing will stand in the way of the party's bid for a third term in power. Mr Blair wa speaking to MPs amid fresh rumour of a rift with Gordon Brown. A new book say the prime minister went back on a pledge to Mr Brown to stand down before the next general election. The chancellor ha said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo Alan Milburn for a Labour poster launch this week. Mr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) on Monday: ""I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."" The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within second of each other and seemingly in good spirit at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour. A new book, Brown's Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, say Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet ally intervened in June 2004. It ha caused a new wave of concern among Labour MPs gearing up to defend their seat in an election, widely expected to be held in May, and several member are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the PLP meeting. Health Secretary John Reid earlier warned that Labour member would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation. He told BBC News: ""Those who co-operate or inspire these books, in my view, have to know that, whatever the short-term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure, they always do it by damaging the record, the unity and the re-election chance of the Labour Party and the government."" Mr Blair on Sunday dismissed claim of broken promises, saying: ""I've dealt with this six month ago. I said then you don't do deal over job like this - you don't."" In a separate BBC interview, Mr Brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by ""gossip"". ""It's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Blair's spokesman said: ""The prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he belief that what people want."" Mr Brown say he discussed the election campaign with Mr Blair on Saturday and promised to play his part. Mr Peston said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"". Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters' trust because of the Iraq war. He had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet ally and suspicion that the chancellor wa manoeuvring against him. Mr Brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything Mr Blair told him. Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox likened the two men to ""self-obsessed schoolboys"". Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said their personal ambition wa ""getting in the way of good government"".

Cyber criminals step up the pace,"So-called phishing attack that try to trick people into handing over confidential detail have boomed in 2004, say security experts. The number of phishing e-mail message stopped by security firm MessageLabs ha risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. Other statistic show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail wa spam and one in 16 message were infected with a virus. In it end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. In September 2003, MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing e-mail that tried to make people visit fake version of the website run by real bank and financial organisations. But by September 2004 it wa stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail message per month. Worryingly, said the firm, phishing gang were using increasingly sophisticated technique to harvest useful information such a login detail or personal data. Older attack relied on user not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting wa fake, but more recent phishing e-mail simply try to steal detail a soon a a message is opened. Other phishing scam try to recruit innocent people into acting a middleman for laundering money or good bought with stolen credit cards. ""E-mail security attack remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,"" said Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at MessageLabs. ""In just 12 month phishing ha firmly established itself a a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,"" he said. Mr Sunner said MessageLabs wa starting to see some phishing attack become very focused on one company or organisation. ""Already particular business are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attack designed to take advantage of the perceived weakness of some businesses,"" he said. Although phishing attack grew substantially throughout 2004, virus and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. One of the biggest outbreak took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating. To date the company ha caught more than 60 million copy of the virus. Also up this year wa the amount of spam in circulation. In 2003 only 40% of message were spam.

Savvy searchers fail to spot ads,"Internet search engine user are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated, suggests a report into search habits. The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87% of searcher usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. It also show that few can spot the difference between paid-for result and organic ones. The report reveals that 84% of net user say they regularly use Google, Ask Jeeves, MSN and Yahoo when online. Almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engine much less, if they knew information about who paid for result wa being hidden. According to figure gathered by the Pew researcher the average user spends about 43 minute per month carrying out 34 separate search and look at 1.9 webpage for each hunt. A significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. For 44% of those questioned, the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find. Search engine user also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. According to Pew Research 44% of searcher use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites. Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves, said the result reflected it own research which showed that people use different search engine because the way the site gather information mean they can provide different result for the same query. Despite this liking for search site half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. A small number, 17%, said they wouldn't really miss search engine if they did not exist. The remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, said they thought that the result they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. Alongside the growing sophistication of net user is a lack of awareness about paid-for result that many search engine provide alongside list of website found by indexing the web. Of those asked, 62% were unaware that someone ha paid for some of the result they see when they carry out a search. Only 18% of all searcher say they can tell which result are paid for and which are not.

Asia shares defy post-quake gloom,"Thailand ha become the first of the 10 southern Asian nation battered by giant wave at the weekend to cut it economic forecast. Thailand's economy is now expected to grow by 5.7% in 2005, rather than 6% a forecast before tsunami hit six tourist provinces. The full economic cost of the disaster remain unclear. In part, this is because of it scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. But Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock market reached record high on Wednesday, suggesting that investor do not fear a major economic impact. The high showed the gap in outlook between investor in large firm and individual who have lost their livelihoods. Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected area - such a Aceh in Indonesia - were so under-developed that the tragedy would little impact on Asia's listed companies, according to analysts. ""Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing. But it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense,"" said ABN Amro chief Asian strategist Eddie Wong. India's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above it previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for it listed property company to gain from rebuilding contract in the tsunami-affected region of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economist have said that a much a 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market ha fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004. Thailand may lose 30bn baht (Â£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome. In the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. ""It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitor in Phuket and five other province return to their normal level,"" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office.

How to make a gigapixel picture,"The largest digital panoramic photo in the world ha been created by researcher in the Netherlands. The finished image is 2.5 billion pixel in size - making it about 500 time the resolution of image produced by good consumer digital cameras. The huge image of Delft wa created by stitching together 600 single snap of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot. If printed out in standard 300 dot per inch resolution, the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long. The researcher have put the image on a website which let viewer explore the wealth of detail that it captures. Tools on the page let viewer zoom in on the city and it surroundings in great detail.

The image wa created by imaging expert from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo a a summer time challenge.

That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park, in Utah, and wa made up of 196 separate photographs. The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons' image. ""He did it all by hand, which wa an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image,"" said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researcher behind the project.

Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plan to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claim would be processed overseas. That prompted some charity to say the plan would put refugees' life at risk if they were turned away once quota were filled. ""If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policy will not provide a safe haven,"" said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council. ""If people turn up in the UK asking for help they will be turned away. Michael Howard's policy effectively mean there is no safe haven in the UK. ""When it come to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decision are made on asylum seekers. So many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decision that are appealed are successfully overturned, rising to half for some nationalities.

But he said it wa ""absolutely disgusting"" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees.

Data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreak and denial of service attacks. Firms signing up for the sensing system include MCI, BT, Deutsche Telekom, Energis, NTT, Bell Canada and many others. The creation of the fingerprinting system ha been brokered by US firm Arbor Networks and signature of attack will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack. Increasingly computer criminal are using swarm of remotely controlled computer to carry out denial of service attack on websites, launch worm and relay spam around the net. ""We have seen attack involving five and ten gigabyte of traffic,"" said Rob Pollard, sale director for Arbor Networks which is behind the fingerprinting system. ""Attacks of that size cause collateral damage a they cross the internet before they get to their destination,"" he said. Once an attack is spotted and it signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of network affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem. Mr Pollard said Arbor wa not charging for the service and it would pas on fingerprint data to every network affected. ""What we want to do is help net service firm communicate with each other and then push the attack further and further back around the world to their source,"" said Mr Pollard. Arbor Network's technology work by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network. It spot which computer or group of user regularly talk to each other and what type of traffic pass between machine or workgroups. Any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrator who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind. This type of close analysis ha become very useful a net attack are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines. Anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack.

Bryan twins keep US hopes alive,"The United States kept the Davis Cup final alive with victory in Saturday's double rubber, leaving Spain 2-1 ahead going into the final day. Masters Cup champion Mike and Bob Bryan thrashed Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo 6-0 6-3 6-2 in front of a partisan crowd in Seville. Victory would have given Spain the title but they were outclassed. In Sunday's reverse singles, Carlos Moya take on Andy Roddick before Rafael Nadal face Mardy Fish. ""It feel good, but it's not going to be a good if we don't win two tomorrow,"" said Mike Bryan. ""It feel good to give those guy another shot, and Spain ha to go to sleep on that."" Bob Bryan added: ""I'm really confident in Andy winning that first match, and then anything can happen."" Spain coach Jordi Arrese chose to rest 18-year-old Nadal in the double after his epic single win over Roddick on Friday. He wa replaced by former world number one Ferrero, but the Spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world's best double teams. The 26-year-old Bryan twin have won all four of their Davis Cup match this year. And they quickly silenced the huge crowd at the Olympic Stadium, racing through the opening set to love. The Spaniards then twice surrendered break of serve at the start of the second before the Bryans broke to go 5-3 ahead and served out. When Robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match wa all but over, and the unflappable Bryan brother powered on to an impressive win. Ferrero, who wa upset to be dropped for Friday's singles, hinted at further dissatisfaction after the defeat. ""It wa a difficult game against the best double players,"" he said.

BMW cash to fuel Mini production,"Less than four year after the new Mini wa launched, German car maker BMW ha announced Â£100m of new investment. Some 200 new job are to be created at the Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 car from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some Â£280m in Mini production. Since it launch during summer 2001, the new Mini ha gone from strength to strength. Last year, almost one in six car sold by the BMW group wa a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. ""Our decision to produce a new Mini wa not received well right away,"" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini model a year at it vast Cowley factory on the outskirt of Oxford, but the target wa quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. ""The risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand, demand taper off like it did with the new VW Beetle,"" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe. The price of the car ha also gone up. When it wa launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than Â£10,000. These days, buyer will have to fork out almost Â£11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which cost up to Â£17,730. The Mini Convertible, which wa launched last spring, cost up to Â£15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model wa launched should still fetch at least Â£8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from Â£12,556, according to the-car buying website Parker's. The consumers' association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE. The Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use. There are plan to tear down old building and build new one and there are rumour that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW's Mini adventure ha made good much of what went wrong during it stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for Â£10 five year ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory wa producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four time a many vehicle were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employ more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hope to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of car produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more car than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sale of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.",business,"Less than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced Â£100m of new investment.Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini.Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again.When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than Â£10,000.These days, buyers will have to fork out almost Â£11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to Â£17,730.The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to Â£15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list.Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge.The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars.BMW's Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for Â£10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium.""Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,"" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board.In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75.Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some Â£280m in Mini production.",0.15438934802571166,"Less than four year after the new Mini wa launched, German car maker BMW ha announced Â£100m of new investment.

'Fido' to be taken off vote lists,"The risk of pet and child being given vote could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK election watchdog ha said. Those are some of the mistake found under the current system, where one person in each household applies for voting form for the other occupants. The Electoral Commission say enabling people to register individually could cut some error and combat fraud. Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May a expected. But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election. The proposed scheme would mean voter using individual ""identifiers"" when they vote - such a their own voting number, date of birth and signature.

Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care wa needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system.

And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth date are not included on the form so election officer cannot easily check. Non-British citizen who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases. Mr Younger said there wa anecdotal evidence of inaccuracy in the register, the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. He argued local council could look harder at promoting targeted campaign at ""hard to reach"" voters, for example. Some authority already run such programme but in others councillor worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular area to turn out. Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officer retrace about 50,000 voters. He argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballot and other new way of voting. There have been fear there are too few check to ensure current postal vote are cast by the person on the voting form. He said it might also help register student in hall of residences, where the hall warden often ha to do the job for everybody. The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committee pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voter in any changeover.

The Federal Reserve ha raised it key federal fund rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the US economy is regaining steam. US company created twice a many job a expected in October while export hit record level in September. Analysts said a clear-cut victory for President Bush in last week's election paved the way for a rise. Another rise could be in store for December, some economist warned. The Fed's Open Market Committee - which set interest rate policy in the US - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise. The Fed ha been gradually easing rate up since the summer, with quarter percentage point rise in June, August and September. The Central Bank ha been acting to restrain inflationary pressure while being careful not to obstruct economic growth. The Fed did not rule out raising rate once again in December but noted that any future increase would take place at a ""measured"" pace. In a statement, the Fed said that long-term inflation pressure remained ""well contained"" while the US economy appeared to be ""growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices"". Financial analyst broadly welcomed the Fed's move and share traded largely flat. The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 0.89 points, or 0.01%, at 10,385.48. Recent evidence ha pointed to an upturn in the US economy. US firm created 337,000 job last month, twice the amount expected, while export reached record level in September. The economy grew 3.7% in the third quarter, slower than forecast, but an improvement on the 3.3% growth seen in the second quarter. Analysts claimed the Fed's assessment of future economic growth wa a positive one but stressed that the jury wa still out on the prospect of a further rise in December. ""Let's wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarter's energy price drag before concluding that the Fed ha more work to do in 2005,"" said Avery Shenfeld, senior economist at CIBC World Markets. ""I think the Federal Reserve doe not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief US economist for Wells Fargo Bank. ""The economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concern about geopolitics, employment and the price of oil,"" he added. The further rise in US rate is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy. The Bank of England (BoE) ha kept interest rate on hold at 4.75% for the past three months, leading some commentator to argue that rate may have peaked. In a report published on Wednesday, the Bank said that with rate at their current level, inflation would rise to it 2% target within two years.

Bank holds interest rate at 4.75%,"The Bank of England ha left interest rate on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.

Rising interest rate and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium.

Mr Frost added: ""The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. ""It is widely accepted that, if house price start falling more sharply, the risk facing the economy will worsen considerably."" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had ""slowed in recent month in response to rate rises"" but that it wa difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer.

""Interest rate are likely to remain on hold for some time."" On Thursday there wa more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, a the Office for National (ONS) statistic revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectation of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rate to continue in the near future. It also said there wa evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning a the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain. ""So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increase have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,"" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. ""However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates."" Some economist have predicted rate will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens.

Economy 'stronger than forecast',"The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax. Private sector business survey suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other survey collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This mean that despite a strong economic growth, base rate will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data come from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data take longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions.

""The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy ha proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy error in the past,"" she said. Improving the quality of national statistic is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) make the right decisions, she said.

Kenyan school turns to handhelds,"At the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya student click away at a handheld computer with a stylus. They are doing exercise in their school textbook which have been digitised. It is a pilot project run by EduVision, which is looking at way to use low cost computer system to get up-to-date information to student who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. Matthew Herren from EduVision told the BBC programme Go Digital how the non-governmental organisation us a combination of satellite radio and handheld computer called E-slates. ""The E-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. The data is transmitted alongside audio signals."" The base station process the information from the satellite transmission and turn it into a form that can be read by the handheld E-slates. ""It downloads from the satellite and every day process the stream, sort through content for the material destined for the user connected to it. It also store this on it hard disc."" The system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. But Mr Herren say there are both pro and con to the project. ""It's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific request from end user is difficult."" The project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problem with the Linux-based system. ""The content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. Users can scroll through these section independently of each other."" EduVision is planning to include audio and video file a the system develops and add more content. Mr Herren say this would vastly increase the opportunity available to the students. He is currently in negotiation to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries. ""All book in the public domain, something like 15 million, could be put on the base station a we manufacture them. Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same library a the student in Oxford and Harvard"" Currently the project is operating in an area where there is main electricity. But Mr Herren say EduVision already ha plan to extend it to more remote regions. ""We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the E-slates charge during the day when the child are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working.""

Ban on hunting comes into force,"Fox hunting with dog is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight. The law face a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunt will be out in force. Chief police officer spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing fox then shooting them. He said police would challenge the ""one of two isolated hunts"" which are threatening to break the law. But Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance ha questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. ""The definition of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. ""You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one,"" he said. The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, ha so far issued no instruction to police on how they should deal with hunter who violate the law. He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police ""in the near future"" to decide what measure to take with regard to hunting prosecutions.

Yukos sues four firms for $20bn,"Russian oil firm Yukos ha sued four company for their role in last year's forced state auction of it key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas. Yukos is claiming more than $20bn (Â£11bn) in damage after Yugansk wa sold in December to settle back taxes. The four company named in the law suit are gas giant Gazprom, it unit Gazpromneft, investment company Baikal, and state oil firm Rosneft. Yukos submitted the suit in Houston, where it filed for bankruptcy.

It also ha vowed to use all legal mean at it disposal to go after any firm that try to buy or take control of it assets. Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for $28.3bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court ha any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow official have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling a meaningless. In Houston, bankruptcy Judge Letitia Clark will start a two-day hearing on 16 February to hear argument on whether a US court is the proper forum for the case. The threat of legal action from Yukos and it bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last year's auction, however. Concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle, Gazprom and Gazpromneft withdrew from the auction, and Yuganskneftegas wa sold to little-known investment firm Baikal Finance Group. A few day later, Baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group Rosneft for $9.3bn. Rosneft, meanwhile, ha agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control.

Ministers 'naive' over phone-taps,"The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says. Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, say phone-tap evidence work in the court of other European countries. Human right groups, top police officer and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspect without charge. But Home Secretary Charles Clarke say the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: ""[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it. ""It would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal."" Mr Solana's comment come the day after Sir Ian Blair, the newly-appointed Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he wa in favour of phone-tap evidence. Under the Anti-Terrorism Crimes and Security Act 2001, foreign terror suspect can be detained in British jail without trial or charge. Several suspect have been detained under these power because evidence against them wa deemed too sensitive to be heard in court. Some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. Human Rights group Liberty ha argued that if intercept evidence could be heard, these detainee could be brought to trial. But critic of phone-tap trial say the evidence is often weak and can expose the method of the security services. The home secretary say intercept would not make much difference because case against terror suspect frequently rely on other kind of surveillance. But Mr Clarke ha been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after Law Lords ruled it illegal. He ha opted for a system of ""control orders"" whereby suspects, both British and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance. These order will again involve a UK opt-out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights. While accepting that people ""have to be prepared"" for a possible terrorist attack, Mr Solana said he had ""qualms"" about the home secretary's new plans.

World leaders gather to face uncertainty,"More than 2,000 business and political leader from around the globe are arriving in the Swiss mountain resort Davos for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF). For five days, they will discus issue ranging from China's economic power to Iraq's future after this Sunday's elections. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leader and head of state leader attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protest against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigner have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEF's ritzier event in Davos. The organiser of the Brazilian gathering, which brings together thousand of campaigner against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit. However, many of the issue discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking point a well. ""Global warming"" feature particularly high. WEF participant are being asked to offset the carbon emission they cause by travelling to the event. Davos itself is in deep frost. The snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill take temperature down to minus 20C and less. Ultimately, the forum will be dominated by business issue - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with boss of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest company scheduled to attend. But much of the medium focus will be on the political leader coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme. ""Taking responsibility for tough choices"" is this year's official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. One thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreement over how to deal with Iran, Iraq and China are set to dominate discussions. Pointedly, only one senior official from President Bush's new administration is scheduled to attend. The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just a happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos. Ukraine's new president, Viktor Yushchenko, is to speak, just day after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protest against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.

Euro firms miss out on optimism,"More than 90% of large company around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 boss suggests. Their biggest worry are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and down of oil prices. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after year of slow growth. When business adviser PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two year ago, nearly 30% of boss were gloomy about their prospects. Global business leader say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. After a string of corporate scandal in the United States - from Enron to WorldCom - the Sarbanes-Oxley act force company to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork cost a lot of time and money. Across Europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed company are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standard called IFRS. Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executive around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors. Already, about 28% of the boss polled for the survey say that they have moved part of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. Possibly a a result, the worry about low-cost competition ha slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of company calling it a ""significant threat"" or ""one of the biggest threats"".

Surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen a a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it wa cited a the third-largest problem. Mr DiPiazza said the interview with chief executive suggested that company had ""adjusted"" to the new reality of a euro that buy $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their position and locked in more favourable exchange rates. - For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executive throughout the world during the last three month of 2004.",business,"Possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a ""significant threat"" or ""one of the biggest threats"".More than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.According to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: ""One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - won't kill your business anymore.""- For the survey, PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.",0.1282213108528898,"More than 90% of large company around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 boss suggests.

""That is not what politician should do, it would not be responsible to do.""

Home phones face unclear future,"The fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. Research by handset maker Nokia show that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the UK, Germany, US and South Korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charge are lower, but most of those questioned said the future wa definitely mobile. The Nokia-sponsored research showed that mobile and fixed phone were used for different purposes. Home phone were used for longer call but conversation on mobile tended to be shorter, between mobile and to friends. In the UK 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it wa still cheaper to use than a mobile. However, when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariff on fixed and mobile phone compared. In the US and Germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it wa more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. In all the country where interview were carried out, older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. Women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone, the research found. The move to mobile wa most pronounced in South Korea where 65% of those questioned said they already make most of their call from a mobile. 18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house. Many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on it position in the home and the ""cosiness"" of making a call there. Nokia said these finding had implication for mobile operator who must work hard to ensure that mobile are seen a cheap, reliable and providing good call quality.

Economy 'strong' in election year,"UK business are set to prosper during the next few month - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report. Optimism is at it highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefit of a continuing rise in public spending, say researcher at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rate on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarter ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity. The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainty associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movement a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted.

Confusion over high-definition TV,"Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets. In most corner of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded a the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. HD essentially make TV picture quality at least four time better than now. But there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about HD on the High Street. Thousands of flat panel screen - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV set - have already been sold a ""HD"", but are in fact not able to display HD. ""The UK is the largest display market in Europe,"" according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitor global consumer markets. But, he added: ""Of all the flat panel screen sold, just 1.3% in the UK are capable of getting high-definition."" There are 74 different device that are being sold a HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra. They may be fantastic quality TVs, but many do not have adaptor in them - called DVI or HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connector - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. Part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the High Street, say industry experts, who gathered at Bafta in London for the 2nd European HDTV Summit last week. ""We have to be careful about consumer confusion. There is a massive education process to go through,"" said Mr Binks. The industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of u who will be watching it. Eventually, that will be everyone. The BBC is currently developing plan to produce all it TV output to meet HDTV standard by 2010. Preparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programme are being filmed with HD cameras. BSkyB plan to ship it first generation set-top boxes, to receive HDTV broadcasts, in time for Christmas. Like it Sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorder (PVRs). The company will start broadcast of HDTV programmes, offering them a ""premium channel packages"", concentrating, to start with, on sports, big events, and films, in early 2006. But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcast ha to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the image at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be ""real"". By 2010, 20% of home in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in it full glory. But it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to ""being digital"". As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, a well a the satellite company and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. Part of the forum ha been concerned with issue like industry standard and content protection. But it ha also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for. From next month, all device that have the right connector and resolution required will carry a ""HD-Ready"" sticker. This also mean they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. ""The logo is absolutely the way forward,"" said David Mercer, analyst with Strategy Analytics. ""But it is still not appearing on many retail products."" The industry is upbeat that the sticker will help, but it is only a start. ""We can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers,"" said Mr Oudendijk. ""There may well be a number of dissatisfied customer in the next few months."" The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavour of HD format to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line. It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, a well a which device will support the formats. ""We believe consumer buying expensive display need to ensure their investment is worthwhile,"" said Phil Laven, technical director for the EBU. The TV display manufacturer want u to watch HD on screen that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the ""true impact"" of HD, they say, although smaller display suffice. What may convince people to spend money on HD-ready device is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across Europe. The price are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts. LCD price dropped by 43% in Europe a a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk.",tech,"But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcasts has to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be ""real"".Thousands of flat panel screens - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets - have already been sold as ""HD"", but are in fact not able to display HD.By 2010, 20% of homes in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in its full glory.The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the ""true impact"" of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice.But there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about HD on the High Street.It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats.HD essentially makes TV picture quality at least four times better than now.There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra.The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavours of HD formats to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line.Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets.This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry.""The UK is the largest display market in Europe,"" according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitors global consumer markets.The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010.LCD prices dropped by 43% in Europe as a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk.As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other.In most corners of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour.",0.07252328042328042,"Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets.

BBC poll indicates economic gloom,"Citizens in a majority of nation surveyed in a BBC World Service poll believe the world economy is worsening.

The poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 country believed the economy wa going downhill, compared with respondent in nine country who believed it wa improving. Those surveyed in three country were split. In percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondent in each country said the world economy wa getting worse, compared to 34% who said it wa improving. Similarly, 48% were pessimistic about their national economy, while 41% were optimistic. And 47% saw their family's economic condition improving, a against 36% who said they were getting worse. The poll of 22,953 people wa conducted by the international polling firm GlobeScan, together with the Program on International Policy Attitudes (Pipa) at the University of Maryland. ""While the world economy ha picked up from difficult time just a few year ago, people seem to not have fully absorbed this development, though they are personally experiencing it effects,"" said Pipa director Steven Kull. ""People around the world are saying: 'I'm OK, but the world isn't'."" There may be a perception that war, terrorism and religious and political division are making the world a worse place, even though that ha not so far been reflected in global economic performance, say the BBC's Elizabeth Blunt. The country where people were most optimistic, both for the world and for their own families, were two fast-growing developing economies, China and India, followed by Indonesia. China ha seen two decade of blistering economic growth, which ha led to wealth creation on a huge scale, say the BBC's Louisa Lim in Beijing.

Mobile networks seek turbo boost,"Third-generation mobile (3G) network need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. That wa one of the message from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week. Fast 3G network are here but the focus ha shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, say the Global Mobile Suppliers Association. At 3GSM, Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 time faster than current 3G networks. The system is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operator on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. Early HSDPA system typically offer around two megabit per second (Mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobit per second (Kbps) on standard 3G networks. ""High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) - sometimes called Super 3G - will be vital for profitable service like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,"" according to a report published by UK-based research consultancy Analysys. A number of company are developing the technology. Nokia and Canada-based wireless communication product company Sierra Wireless recently agreed to work together on High Speed Downlink Packet Access. The two company aim to jointly market the HSDPA solution to global network operator customers. ""While HSDPA theoretically enables data rate up to a maximum of 14Mbps, practical throughput will be lower than this in wide-area networks,"" said Dr Alastair Brydon, author of the Analysys report: Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements. ""The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic WCDMA [3G],"" he added. Motorola ha conducted five trial of it technology and say speed of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device. But some mobile operator are opting for a technology called Evolution, Data Optimised (EV-DO). US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to it 3G network at the end of last year. We are ""expanding our network and deploying EV-DO technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds,"" said Oliver Valente, Sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract wa announced. As part of $3bn in multi-year contract announced late last year, Sprint will spend around $1bn on EV-DO technology from Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speed of 0.3-0.5 megabit a second, and peak download rate of 2.4Mbps. MMO2, the UK-based operator with service in the UK, Ireland and Germany, ha opted for technology based on HSDPA. Using technology from Lucent, it will offer data speed of 3.6Mbps from next summer on it Isle of Man 3G network, and will eventually support speed of up to 14.4Mbps. US operator Cingular Wireless is also adopting HSDPA, using technology from Lucent alongside equipment from Siemens and Ericsson. Siemens' plan for a one gigabit network may be more than a user need today, but Christoph Caselitz, president of the mobile network division at the firm say that: ""By the time the next generation of mobile communication debut in 2015, the need for transmission capacity for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10."" Siemens - in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology - ha souped up mobile communication by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. This enables a data transmission, such a sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flow of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. The speed offered by 3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operator were paying huge sum for 3G licences. But today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband network that offer speed of 0.5 megabit a second - much faster than 3G. This mean user are likely to find 3G disappointing unless the network are souped up. If they aren't, those lucrative ""power users"", such a computer geek and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenue available to mobile operators. But one gigabit a second system will not be available immediately. Siemens say that though the system work in the laboratory, it still ha to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae device and conduct field trials.

Castaignede fires Laporte warning,"Former France fly-half Thomas Castaignede ha warned the pressure is mounting on coach Bernard Laporte following their defeat by Wales. France suffered a shock loss against the Welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win. Castaignede told BBC Sport: ""The pressure is big on Laporte after a huge loss to New Zealand, a slim win over Scotland and a miracle against England. ""But the French have to get behind him and the team at Lansdowne Road."" Following victory over South Africa and Australia in November, France were deemed by many to be the world's leading side. But they were then trounced 45-6 by New Zealand and only just beat Scotland after the Scots had a try disallowed in their Six Nations opener. It then took some woeful spot kicking from Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley to help them to victory against England at Twickenham. &lt; Castaignede said: ""You can't say any of those result have eased the pressure on Laporte. ""Had England's kicker not been so bad, the position in the Six Nations would be very different now."" Laporte ha been criticised for France's negative tactic in their win over Scotland and England. But his side played a more free-flowing style against Wales, making a mockery of the opposition's defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortune after the interval. ""All the chat in France ha been about how France will play against Ireland,"" said Castaignede ahead of the 12 March tie. ""Everyone want to see the sort of play we saw against Wales. But everyone also want a win."" Castaignede, a veteran of 43 international caps, admitted the French would go in a underdog against Ireland. ""Going to Ireland is never easy but the way they're playing right now, it's harder than ever,"" said Castaignede. ""They're very experienced and don't often lose at home. They've got some great forward and some electric runner on the break."" Despite praising the Irish he claimed the Welsh had the upper hand in the Six Nations run-in. ""Ireland have such a good pack but Wales are something else on the break,"" he added. ""At the weekend they were simply awesome. As a Frenchman it wa disappointing to see, but you had to admire it. ""Their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship."" The 30-year-old also tipped Yann Delaigue to start ahead of Frederic Michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in Paris last weekend.

Camera phones are 'must-haves',"Four time more mobile with camera in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, say a report from analyst Gartner. Globally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phone sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobile is making them an increasingly ""must-have"" buy. In Europe, camera on mobile can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobile have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobile sold there will have camera on them. Camera phone had some teething problem when they were first launched a people struggled with poor quality image and us for them, a well a the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This ha changed in the last 18 months. Handset maker have concentrated on trying to make phone easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phone in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screen and viewfinders, removable memory card and easier control to send picture messages. Mobile company have introduced more way for people to share photo with other people. These have included giving people easier way to publish them on websites, or mobile blog - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increase more, people will not be interested in printing out picture at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside camera phone is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phone will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital camera image range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phone more like digital cameras. Some handset already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturer are looking into technological improvement that will let people take more photo in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other development include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensor and processor for recording film clips. Images from camera phone have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snap taken from the camera phone of top artists. The exhibition, Fonetography, will feature image taken by photographer David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artist Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some us for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phone from their building for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centre and local council have also banned them over fear about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner ha also voiced concern and ha issued guideline on where and how the phone can be used. But camera phone fear have not dampened the manufacturers' profits.

Blair congratulates Bush on win,"Tony Blair ha said he look forward to continuing his strong relationship with George Bush and working with him during his second term a president.

The election of the US president wa significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of it special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his ""warmest congratulations"", saying: ""We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom."" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000. Mr Bush's first task wa to ""rebuild a sense of domestic purpose"" within the US, he said.

Warning over US pensions deficit,"Taxpayers may have to bail out the US agency that protects workers' pension funds, leading economist have warned.

Court mulls file-sharing future,"Judges at the US Supreme Court have been hearing evidence for and against file-sharing networks. The court will decide whether producer of file-sharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement. They questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue file-sharers could deter innovation. They also said that file-trading firm had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy. The lawsuit, brought by 28 of the world's largest entertainment firms, ha raged for several years. Legal expert agree that if the Supreme Court find in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file-trading firm into bankruptcy. But if the judge rule that Grokster and Morpheus - the file-sharers at the centre of the case - are merely provider of technology that can have legitimate a well a illegitimate uses, then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon it pursuit of file-sharing providers. Instead, they would have to pursue individual who use peer-to-peer network to get their hand on free music and movies. The hi-tech and entertainment industry have been divided on the issue. Intel filed a document with the Supreme Court earlier this month in defence of Grokster and others, despite misgiving about some aspect of the file-sharing community. It summed up the attitude of many tech firm in it submission which state that it product ""are essentially tools, that like any other tools, capable of being used by consumer and business for unlawful purposes"". Asking firm to second-guess the us that it technology would be put to, and to build in way of preventing illegitimate use, would stifle innovation, it said. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil right watchdog, is also defending StreamCast Networks, the company behind the Morpheus file-sharing software. The case raise a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation, it said. It cites, a do many, the landmark ruling in 1984 which found that Sony should not be held responsible for the fact that it Betamax video recorder could be used for piracy. Defenders remain optimistic that the judge will rule in favour of the peer-to-peer networks, upholding the precedent set by the Sony Betamax case. A small band of supporter were outside the court a the lawyer entered, wearing ""Save Betamax"" t-shirts. ""The Betamax principle stand a the Magna Carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that ha occurred in the US over the past 20 years,"" said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Electronics Association. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said that invention from printing to Apple's iPod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted material but had, on balance, been beneficial to society. He said that while file-trading software can be used to illegally trade movie and music, conceptually the technology had ""some really excellent uses"". Based on Tuesday's hearing it seems unlikely that the Betamax ruling will be overturned but file-sharing firm might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy. Grokster's lawyer argued that the company should be judged by it current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up. But this argument wa dismissed a ""ridiculous"" by Justice David Souter. CEA bos Mr Shapiro think the case is the most important that the Supreme Court will hear this year. ""It's about preserving America's proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumer to access and utilise technology,"" he said.

Robotic pods take on car design,"A new breed of wearable robotic vehicle that envelop driver are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota. The company's vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walk upright on two feet. Both these prototype will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicle and helper robots, at the Toyota stand at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, in March 2005. The model are being positioned a so-called personal mobility devices, which have few limits. The open leaf-like ""i-unit"" vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. Built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials, the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technology that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. The model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns, move upright amongst other people at low speed and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. Body colour can be customized to suit individual preference and a personal recognition system offer both information and music. Also on display at the show will be the egg-shaped ""i-foot"". This is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick. Standing at a height of well over seven foot (2.1 metres), the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircase into the bargain. Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like leg that bend over backwards. ""They are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative idea which have yet to be transformed into potential product and which are a few year away from actual production,"" said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University. ""They clearly have eye-catching appeal, which is in part the name of the game here, and are linked to the iMac and iPod-type niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent year - new, different, hi-tech, image conscious products. ""As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see 'who' they would appeal to and what their role would be in the 'personal transport' marketplace."" The personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic device that augment human capabilities. Toyota's prototype represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeleton in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. Powered robotic exoskeleton have been the focus of much US military research over the year and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of product being developed for specific applications. With an emerging range of device targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeleton seem to represent a new line of future technology that meet an individual's particular mobility needs. While Toyota's prototype are geared towards mass transport, the company say that the vehicle will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility. Experts, though, are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area. ""Those with arguably the greatest need for this sort of assistance, now and certainly in the future, are the elderly and infirm people,"" Dr Gillingwater told the BBC News website. ""You have to ask whether these sort of vehicle will appeal to these groups."" Design consideration also exist. Dr Erel Avineri, of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said: ""The design of the introduced mobility device is not completely adjusted to the specific need of the elderly and the disabled. ""For example, one problem that many older passenger experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body, making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up. ""It look like the visual design of the device interior doe not consider this need. This and other human-factors related issue in the design of such device are not the only issue that should be considered,"" said Dr Avineri. ""In general, introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour pattern that have served the older passenger for decades. Elderly user might not necessarily accept such innovation. ""This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle."" Such single-person vehicle may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised application rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. ""The concept of personal mobility behind these sort of innovation is great but they beg a huge number of questions,"" said Dr Gillingwater. ""What's their range? How user-friendly will they really be? What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicle to be used.

File-swappers ready new network,"Legal attack on website that help people swap pirated film have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down. One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing it own software that avoids the pitfall of the earlier program. A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January. But doubt remain about the new network ability to ensure file being swapped are ""quality copies"". In late December movie studio launched a legal campaign against website that helped people swap pirated movie using the BitTorrent network. The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised. That file-sharing system relies on link called ""trackers"" that point user to others happy to share the file they are looking for. Shutting down site that listed tracker crippled the BitTorrent network. One of the site shut down by the legal campaign wa suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that tracker led to the movie or TV programme they claimed to. Now the man behind suprnova.org, who go by the nickname Sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed Exeem. In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine idea from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems. Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have tracker that help point people toward the file they want. Like Kazaa these tracker will be held by everyone. There will be no centrally maintained list. This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movie and music. The Exeem software ha been under development for a few month and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. An early public version of the software should be available before February. Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software wa in development. There were no plan for a Linux or Mac version. He said that cost of writing the software will be paid for by advert appearing in the finished version of the program. Despite Suprnova administrator Sloncek's involvement with Exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis. Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate file being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream. Dr Johan Pouwelse, a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who study peer-to-peer networks, said Exeem wa the next evolution in file-sharing systems. But, he said, it would struggle to be a popular a BitTorrent and Suprnova because early version were not taking enough care to make sure good copy of file were being shared. ""Exeem cannot prevent pollution,"" he said. ""The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake file and fake ratings,"" he said. Studies have shown that organisation working for record label and movie studio have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes. By contrast moderator on Suprnova made sure file being shared were high quality. ""The moderator are the difference between having a system that work and one that's full of crap like Kazaa,"" he said. ""There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,"" he said. Mr Pouwelse said that future version of file-sharing system are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that let moderator prove who they are to the network and rate which file are worth downloading. When big file were being shared moderation system were key, said Mr Pouwelse. He added that the legal attack on BitTorrent had driven people away from site such a Suprnova but many user had simply migrated to other tracker listing site many of which have seen huge increase in traffic. ""It's hard to compete with free,"" he said.

Women MPs reveal sexist taunts,"Women MPs endure ""shocking"" level of sexist abuse at the hand of their male counterparts, a new study shows.

Some 83 MPs gave their answer in 100 hour of taped interview for the study ""Whose Secretary are You, minister"". The research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievement and experience of woman at Westminster. But what emerged wa complaint from MPs of all party of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insult and patronising assumption about their abilities. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called ""Blair Babes"" elected in 1997, told researchers: ""I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breast - imaginary breast - in their hand and wiggle them and say 'melons' a we spoke.""

Online games play with politics,"After bubbling under for some time, online game broke through onto the political arena in 2004.

The first official political campaign game wa technically launched during the last week of 2003: the Iowa Game, commissioned by the Democrat hopeful Howard Dean.

Others helped raise the stake during the Bush/Kerry contest by highlighting a candidate's virtue or his vices. The phenomenon ha astonished the forefather of political games, a handful of multi-discipline game enthusiast keen to push frontiers.

Many artist and designer are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in project such a newsgaming.com. The aim is to comment on international news event via games. The ability of game to simulate reality make them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situation in an original way. ""Video game generate strong reaction mainly because they are new, but also because our culture need to learn how to deal with simulation,"" Mr Frasca told the BBC News website. This wa the case with the one he created for a political party in Uruguay, Cambiemos, an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country's problem could be solved by working together. ""It's up to u to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games."" Ultimately, Dr Frasca see game a a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes, fear and beliefs. ""Children learn a lot about the world through play. There is no reason why we adult should stop doing it a we grow up."" But expert estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns. This is hardly surprising, compared to other form of mass medium like the worldwide web. Only a few year ago, most politician did not have a webpage, while now it is almost a must-have.

Winemaker rejects Foster's offer,"Australian winemaker Southcorp ha rejected a takeover offer worth 3.1bn Australian dollar ($2.3bn; Â£1.8bn) from brewing giant Foster's Group. Southcorp, whose brand include Penfolds, Rosemount and Lindemans, dismissed the offer a inadequate. The two company held four day of talk after Foster's bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on 13 January. A merger would create a global player with worldwide annual sale of 39m case and revenue of A$2.6bn. Southcorp said Foster's A$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a ""excellent strategic fit"" but undervalued the company. ""Southcorp's board ha informed Foster's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer a it doe not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company,"" said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn.

US bank boss hails 'genius' Smith,"US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan ha given a speech at a Scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist, Adam Smith.

Dr Greenspan wa invited by Chancellor Gordon Brown, whose minister father John used to preach at the St Bryce Kirk church. Mr Brown introduced Dr Greenspan to the 400 invited guest a the ""the world's greatest economist"". Dr Greenspan, 79, who ha been in the UK to attend the G7 meeting in London, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to Smith, whose genius he compared to that of Mozart. He said the philosopher wa a ""towering contributor to the modern world"". ""Kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of Adam Smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor wa reared. ""I am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor's renowned economic and financial skill are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area."" He continued: ""Smith reached far beyond the insight of his predecessor to frame a global view of how market economics, just then emerging, worked. ""In so doing he supported change in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standard of living."" Dr Greenspan said Smith's revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. ""The incredible insight of a handful of intellectual of the Enlightenment - especially with Smith toiling in the environs of Kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest,"" he said. Following his lecture, Dr Greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the Queen at Balmoral in 2002 - wa awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He later opened an exhibition dedicated to Smith in the atrium of Fife College of Further and Higher Education. Joyce Johnston, principal of the college, said: ""It is very fitting that the world's premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world's first economist.""

Mobiles get set for visual radio,"The growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade ha been nothing less than astonishing, but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked. Games, camera and music player have all been added to our handset in the last few years, but 2005 could see another big innovation that won't just see a change in our mobile phone habit - it might alter the way we listen to the radio. Finnish handset giant Nokia ha been working on a technology called Visual Radio, which take an existing FM signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancement such a information and pictures. It is not the first time that such an idea ha been suggested - the early day of DAB Digital Radio had similar intention that never really saw the light of day. One problem is that the name Visual Radio lead people to think of television but Reidar Wasenius, a senior project manager at Nokia, wa adamant that Visual Radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium. He said: ""I'm very happy to say it's not television, what we're talking about is an enhancement of radio a we know it today. ""If you have a Visual Radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you don't know, or there's a competition or vote that you'd like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you've just been listening to."" That visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station, and sends out different kind of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to. As well a detail on the track or artist of a particular song, there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself, in a similar way to digital television's ""red button"" content. Possible interactive content includes competitions, vote and even the chance to rate the song that is playing. But the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations, who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activity on a real-time basis. This in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue, a it is very likely that advertiser will be keen to exploit new opportunity to reach listeners. As the Visual Radio content is transmitted by existing GPRS technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network. And there will be a cost for the service a well, although it may depend on your usage. ""If you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it'll be two or three pound per month,"" said Mr Wasenius. ""But typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an 'all you can eat' arrangement per month."" The payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet work versus dial-up connections. One thing that is for sure - assuming that Nokia retains it market share in handsets, it is estimating that there will be 100 million Visual Radio-enabled mobile phone in circulation by the end of 2006. ""Basically, Visual Radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tool with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before."" The first Visual Radio service in the UK will begin in a few month time with Virgin Radio, who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners. Station manager Steve Taylor commented: ""Listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way. ""Not only doe this give listener more information on the music we play but mean they can instantly purchase thing they like; mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets."" Initially Visual Radio functionality will be limited to two Nokia handset due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful, it is very likely that other manufacturer will want to join them.

Mobile multimedia slow to catch on,"There is no doubt that mobile phone sporting camera and colour screen are hugely popular. Consumers swapping old phone for slinkier, dinkier version are thought to be responsible for a 26% increase in the number of phone sold during the third quarter of 2004, according to analyst Gartner More than 167 million handset were sold globally between July and September 2004, a period that, according to Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi is ""seldom strong"". But although consumer have mobile that can take and send snaps, sound and video clip few, so far, are taking the chance to do so. In fact, the number of people not taking and sending pictures, audio and video is growing. Figures gathered by Continental Research show that 36% of British camera phone user have never sent a multimedia message (MMS), up from 7% in 2003. This is despite the fact that, during the same period, the number of camera phone in the UK more than doubled to 7.5 million. Getting mobile phone user to send multimedia message is really important for operator keen to squeeze more cash out of their customer and offset the cost of subsidising the handset people are buying. The problem they face, said Shailendra Jain, head of MMS firm Adamind, is educating people in how to send the multimedia message using their funky handsets. ""Also,"" he said, ""they have to simplify the interface so it not rocket science in term of someone understanding it."" Research bear out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia message because they do not know how to. According to Continental Research, 29% of the people it questioned said they were technophobe that tended to shy away from innovation. Only 11% regarded themselves a technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. The fact that multimedia service are not interoperable across network and phone only add to people's reluctance to start sending them, said Mr Jain. ""They ask themselves: 'If I'm streaming video from one handset to another will it work?'"" he said. ""There's a lot of user apprehension about that."" There are other deeper technical reason why multimedia message are not being pushed a strongly a they might. Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said mobile phone operator cap the number of message that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. ""The rate we can send MMS into the mobile network is fairly constant,"" he said. The reason for this is that there are finite capacity for data traffic on the second generation network that currently have the most users. No-one want to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channel so the number of MMS message is capped, said Mr Bud. This ha led to operator finding other technologies, particularly one known a Wap-push, to get multimedia to their customers. But when network do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers, the result can be dramatic. Israeli technology firm Celltick ha found a way to broadcast data across phone network in a way that doe not overwhelm existing bandwidth. One of the first firm to use the Celltick service is Hutch India, the largest mobile firm in the country. The broadcast system get multimedia to customer via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. While not multimedia messaging, such a system get people used to seeing their phone a a device that can handle all different type of content. As a result 40% of the subscriber to the Hutch Alive, which us Celltick's broadcast technology, regularly click for more pictures, sound and image from the operator. ""Operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers,"" said Yaron Toren, spokesman for Celltick.

Its share fell nearly 3% in London a the bank raised fund for the deal by selling new stock worth Â£1bn ($1.8bn), equal to 10% of it share capital. Standard Chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from KFB. The South Korean bank will also make up 22% of the group's total assets. The move, a year after Citigroup beat Standard Chartered to buy Koram bank, would be the South Korean financial sector's biggest foreign takeover. This time around, Standard Chartered is thought to have beaten HSBC to the deal. KFB is South Korea's seventh largest bank, with 3 million retail customers, 6% of the country's banking market and an extensive branch network. The country's banking market is three time the size of Hong Kong's with annual revenue of $44bn. Standard Chartered ha it headquarters in London but doe two third of it business in Asia, and much of the rest in Africa. ""We're comfortable with the price paid...the key here ha been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won,"" said Standard Chartered chief executive Mervyn Davies at a London press conference. Standard Chartered said KFB wa a ""well-managed, conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce"" and represented a ""significant acquisition in a growth market"". In London, Standard Chartered's sale of 118 million new share to institutional investor pushed it share price down, and contributing to the FTSE 100's 0.3% decline. Standard Chartered's share were 28 penny lower at 925p by midday. Some analyst also queried whether Standard Chartered had overpaid for KFB. The deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by April 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006, Standard Chartered said. Rival banking giant HSBC, which is based in London and Hong Kong, wa also in the running. Standard Chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together a bid during the Christmas break. ""They were able to move so quickly it caught HSBC by surprise,"" the Financial Times newspaper quoted an insider in the talk a saying. HSBC will now have to wait for the next South Korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be Korea Exchange Bank, also currently in the hand of a US group. Standard Chartered said it wa buying 100% of KFB, an agreement that would bring an end to the bank's complex dual ownership. The South Korean government owns 51.4% of KFB, while the remaining shareholding, and operational control, are in the hand of US private equity group Newbridge Capital. Newbridge bought it stake during the government's nationalisation of several bank in the wake of the 1997 Asia-wide currency crisis which crippled South Korea's financial institutions. South Korea's economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year. Although often thought of an export-driven economy, South Korea's service sector ha overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so. Services now make up roughly 40% of the economy, and consumer spending and retail banking have become increasingly important. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, the government encouraged the growth of consumer credit. Bad loan problem followed; LG Card, the country's biggest credit card provider, ha been struggling to avoid bankruptcy for months, for instance. But analyst believe South Korea's financial service industry is still in it infancy, offering plenty of scope for new products.

Cairn shares slump on oil setback,"Shares in Cairn Energy, a UK oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.

It also said the Indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which Cairn argues it is not liable. Cairn's share have jumped by almost 400% this year. Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil find in India this year. Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he wa ""disappointed"" with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan. Investors had held high hope of major oil find in this area. But Cairn said estimate had been revised in what wa a ""significant downgrade of the initial expectation"".

""Cairn refutes the government's position,"" Mr Gammell said. He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - and not the contractor. ""We have a pretty strong legal case here,"" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. Investors took a dim view of the statement though. The share closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. ""I think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,"" said analyst Jason Kenney at ING. The disappointment overshadowed increased production target for Cairn's existing oilfields. The company raised target for it Mangala and Aishwariya field in India from 60,000 barrel a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrel a day. Its Mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is it biggest find to date. ""These two field will provide the core of the future development in Rajasthan,"" Mr Gammell said. Cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. Mr Gammell set up the company in the 1980s and ha successfully switched it focus to South Asia from interest in the US and Europe.

When technology gets personal,"In 2020, whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass&#233;. By then phone will be printed directly on to wrists, or other part of the body, say Ian Pearson, BT's resident futurologist. It's all part of what's known a a ""pervasive ambient world"", where ""chips are everywhere"". Mr Pearson doe not have a crystal ball. His job is to formulate idea based on what science and technology are doing now, to guide industry into the future. Inanimate object will start to interact with us: we will be surrounded - on streets, in homes, in appliances, on our body and possibly in our head - by thing that ""think"". Forget local area network - these will be body area networks. Ideas about just how smart, small, or even invisible, technology will get are always floating around. Images of device clumsily bolted on to head or wrist have pervaded thinking about future technology. But now a new vision is surfacing, where smart fabric and textile will be exploited to enhance functionality, form, or aesthetics. Such material are already starting to change how gadget and electronics are used and designed. So MP3 player - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one's clothing, say Mr Pearson. ""So the gadget that fill up your handbag, when we integrate those into fabric, we can actually get rid of all that stuff. You won't necessarily see the electronics."" Wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up, while ""video tattoos"", or intelligent electronic contact lenses, might function a TV screen for those on the move. However, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuse with the body itself, raise ethical questions. If technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing, jewellery, and skin, there need to be some serious thinking about what it mean for u a humans, say Baroness Susan Greenfield. At a recent conference for technology, engineering, academic and fashion industry experts, at the Royal Society in London, neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield cautioned we ""can't just sleepwalk into the future"". Yet this technology is already upon us. Researchers have developed computer and sensor worn in clothing. MP3 jackets, based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves, have already appeared in shops. These ""smart fabrics"" have come about through advance in nano- and micro-engineering - the ability to manipulate and exploit material at micro or molecular scale. At the nanoscale, material can be ""tuned"" to display unusual property that can be exploited to build faster, lighter, stronger and more efficient device and systems. The textile and clothing industry ha been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways. Many development are appearing in real product in the field of medicine, defence, healthcare, sports, and communications. Professional swimming suit reduce drag by incorporating tiny structure similar to shark skin. Nanoscale titanium dioxide (TiO2) coating give fabric antibacterial and anti-odour properties. These have special property which can be activated in contact with the air or UV light. Such coating have already been used to stop sock smelling for instance, to turn airline seat into super stain-resistant surfaces, and applied to window so they clean themselves. Dressings for wound can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal property and smart patch are being developed to deliver drug through the skin. But Baroness Greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being. If our clothing, skin, and ""personal body networks"" do the talking and the monitoring, everywhere we go, we have to think about what that mean for our concept of privacy. Mr Pearson pick up the theme, pointing out there are a lot of issue human have to iron out before we become ""cyborgian"". His main concern is ""privacy"". ""We are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don't want every passer-by to know. ""So we have to make sure we build security in this. If you are wearing smart make-up, where electronics are controlling the appearance, you don't want people hacking in and writing message on your forehead."" As technology infiltrates our biology, how will our brain function differently? ""We cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this,"" warns Baroness Greenfield. There have already been successful experiment to grow human nerve cell on circuit boards. This pave the way for brain implant to help paralysed people interface directly with computers. Clearly, the organic, carbon of our body and silicon is increasingly merging. The cyborg - a very familiar part-human, part-inorganic science fiction and academic idea - is on it way.",tech,"If technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing, jewellery, and skin, there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans, says Baroness Susan Greenfield.If our clothing, skin, and ""personal body networks"" do the talking and the monitoring, everywhere we go, we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy.But Baroness Greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being.However, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuses with the body itself, raises ethical questions.Yet this technology is already upon us.His job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now, to guide industries into the future.Wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up, while ""video tattoos"", or intelligent electronic contact lenses, might function as TV screens for those on the move.Such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed.At a recent conference for technology, engineering, academic and fashion industry experts, at the Royal Society in London, neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield cautioned we ""can't just sleepwalk into the future"".Ideas about just how smart, small, or even invisible, technology will get are always floating around.As technology infiltrates our biology, how will our brains function differently?So MP3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one's clothing, says Mr Pearson.By then phones will be printed directly on to wrists, or other parts of the body, says Ian Pearson, BT's resident futurologist.""We are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don't want every passer-by to know.Images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology.""We cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this,"" warns Baroness Greenfield.MP3 jackets, based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves, have already appeared in shops.",0.11842489521060949,"In 2020, whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass&#233;.

Police probe BNP mosque leaflet,"Police are investigating a British National Party leaflet posted to home in south Wales opposing plan for a new mosque. Anti-racism campaigner in Swansea have handed copy to South Wales Police.

Labour battle plan 'hides Blair',"The Tories have accused Tony Blair of being ""terrified"" of scrutiny after Labour unveiled detail of how it will fight the next general election. In a break with tradition, the party will ditch the leader's battle bus and daily press briefing in Westminster. Instead Mr Blair will travel to key city and marginal seat to deliver the party's message. Labour election chief Alan Milburn denied the party wa trying to ""hide"" the prime minister. He promised ""the most positive and upbeat election campaign Labour ha ever run"". But Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said Labour's plan showed Mr Blair wa ""terrified of facing proper scrutiny"". ""At a time when the British people are looking for more accountability and openness, this government turn it back on them; abandoning plan to tour the country and scared to face journalist in a press conference - it doe rather beg the question, 'What have they got to hide?'"" The general election is widely expected next May and all the party are stepping up their campaign preparations. Mr Milburn said the economy would take centre stage in Labour's campaign in what would be a ""watershed"" election and the ""last stand of the Thatcherites"". Mr Milburn said Labour's slogan would be ""Britain is working - Don't let the Tories wreck it."" The tone of the campaign, said Mr Milburn, would be more conversational than rhetorical; more spontaneous less scripted; less national more local and less based on issue and more concentrated on people. The approach is particularly designed to appeal to woman voters, he said. Mr Milburn brushed aside question over why the chancellor wa not present at the Cabinet meeting to discus election strategy particularly since such importance wa being given to the economy. ""I'm not privy to everybody's diary,"" he said. Mr Brown ha headed Labour's preparation for previous poll but Mr Milburn is taking that role this time. In a break with the past, Labour will not hold a daily news conference in London. It will not be a ""battle bus"" style campaign either, he said. In previous elections, each party leader ha had their own battle bus transporting national newspaper, television and radio reporter to staged campaign event around the country. Mr Milburn said Labour's medium effort this time would focus more on local newspaper and broadcasters, with every local radio station given the chance to interview the prime minister. Mr Milburn said there would also be a greater effort to set up face-to-face meeting between minister and the electorate. Former Downing Street medium chief Alastair Campbell is also returning to advise Labour on medium strategy and campaigning. Mr Milburn said no decision had been taken yet over whether David Blunkett would have a prominent role in the election. Liberal Democrat chief executive Lord Rennard suggested Labour wa avoiding news conference in London because it wanted less scrutiny of it record and proposals. ""Tony Blair seems to have disappeared from Labour leaflet and broadcasts,"" he said.

Lawyer attacks anti-terror laws,"A senior barrister who ha resigned in protest over the government's anti-terror law say the current system is giving Britain a bad name. Ian MacDonald QC quit when the government failed to recognise a House of Lords ruling that detaining terror suspect indefinitely is unlawful. He wa part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. Five more barrister are now reported to be threatening to resign. Mr MacDonald told BBC News: ""The reason why I am resigning is because I fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. ""The current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community. ""I think it is giving Britain a bad name internationally"". Under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks, foreign national suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. But Mr MacDonald belief that detainee currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. ""My own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury, a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. ""As far a I'm concerned, the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this."" he added. The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday. According to the Independent, his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barrister - Nicholas Blake QC, Andrew Nicol QC, Manjit Singh Gill QC, Rick Scannell and Tom de la Mare. They are all believed to be carefully considering their position on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainee before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which try terror suspects. Mr MacDonald said he had ""no idea"" whether further resignation would follow. But Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty, told Radio 4's Today programme that more lawyer may go. ""I can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyer may be resigning,"" he said. ""They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, ha been abandoned and that is what give some of them sleepless nights."" Helena Kennedy, a Labour peer and a human right lawyer, said the Special Advocates' main concern wa that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. ""When this whole procedure wa being considered immediately after 11 September there wa a great deal of argument particularly in the House of Lords about whether there really wa a process that could be considered a judicial review,"" she said.

Explaining why Hitachi's Emiew used wheel instead of feet, Toshihiko Horiuchi, from Hitachi's Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, said: ""We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people."" ""We want to make the robot useful for people ... If the robot moved slower than people, user would be frustrated."" Emiew - Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existence a Workmate - can move at 3.7m/h. Its ""wheel feet"" resemble the bottom half of a Segway scooter. With sensor on the head, waist, and near the wheels, Pal and Chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. ""I want to be able to walk about in place like Shinjuku and Shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars,"" Pal told reporters. Hitachi said Pal and Chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be ""trained"" for practical office and factory use in a little a five to six years. Robotics researcher have long been challenged by developing robot that walk in the gait of a human. At the recent AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) annual meeting in Washington DC, researcher showed off bipedal designs. The three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait. Sony and Honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, a a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. Honda's Asimo wa ""born"" five year ago.

Kennedy criticises 'unfair' taxes,"Gordon Brown ha failed to tackle the ""fundamental unfairness"" in the tax system in his ninth Budget, Charles Kennedy ha said. How wa it right that the poorest 20% of society were still paying more a a proportion of their income than the richest 20%, the Lib Dem leader asked. The new Â£200 council tax rebate for pensioner did nothing to fix the ""unfair tax"", he added. The government could not go on ""patching up"" the system, he added. Speaking in the Commons after Mr Brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last Budget before the general election, Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the UK wa one of the most successful economy in the world. But he criticised both the chancellor and the Tories for failing to address the ""ticking bomb"" of council tax revaluation. He said the recent experience of Wales indicated seven million household in England would pay significantly more after revaluation. The chancellor's announcement that he wa to offer a Â£200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner household wa merely a ""sticking plaster"" to a much bigger problem. The Lib Dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than Â£450 a year, with half of all pensioner paying no local tax and about three million being better off. On pensions, Mr Kennedy said it wa a ""scandal"" that the system discriminated against woman who had missed making National Insurance payment when they were having children. He said a residency criterion would end ""at a stroke this fundamental iniquity"". Mr Kennedy added his party's priority of free long-term care for the elderly, abolishing top-up fee and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than Â£100,000 per annum. He contrasted his approach with Mr Brown's pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax. The chancellor went on to put up National Insurance contribution after the election. ""For most individuals, most families, most households, it add up to exactly the same thing,"" said Mr Kennedy. ""And they wonder why people get cynical about their politician when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election.""",politics,"Mr Kennedy added his party's priorities of free long-term care for the elderly, abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than Â£100,000 per annum.The new Â£200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the ""unfair tax"", he added.The Lib Dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than Â£450 a year, with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off.On pensions, Mr Kennedy said it was a ""scandal"" that the system discriminated against women who had missed making National Insurance payments when they were having children.Gordon Brown has failed to tackle the ""fundamental unfairness"" in the tax system in his ninth Budget, Charles Kennedy has said.He contrasted his approach with Mr Brown's pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax.Speaking in the Commons after Mr Brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last Budget before the general election, Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the UK was one of the most successful economies in the world.",0.1362914862914863,"Gordon Brown ha failed to tackle the ""fundamental unfairness"" in the tax system in his ninth Budget, Charles Kennedy ha said.

Desailly backs Blues revenge trip,"Marcel Desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when Chelsea take on Barcelona on Wednesday.

""Now everyone know about Chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. They are one of the major club in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona."" Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five year ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goal from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strike from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert. Former Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, say there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. ""Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their player are young,"" the 36-year-old said. ""We made some mistake at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. ""It would not happen now. This team ha a new motivation and a different mentality."" World Cup winner Desailly saw huge change during his time at Stamford Bridge. He wa signed for Â£4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly say the Russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club a well a a demand for success. ""The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,"" he said. ""Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. ""Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season."" Desailly is one of the most decorated player in the history of football. He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A title and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea. He is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the like of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry. So he is full of admiration for two of his colleague from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta.

A November to remember,"Last Saturday, one newspaper proclaimed that England were still the number one side in the world. That statement wa made to look a little foolish by event later that afternoon at Twickenham. But it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of Test rugby at the highest level, at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. The final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion, with Australia's triumph in London followed by France's capitulation to New Zealand. ""Clearly, there is no number one side in the world at the moment,"" declared Wallabies coach Eddie Jones on arrival back in Sydney. ""There are four, five or probably six side all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%."" While that bodes well for rugby a a whole, it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open Six Nations Championship for a decade. While the Wallabies, All Blacks and Springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to Super 12 matter in the new year, Europe's finest have less than 10 week before they return to the international fray. And for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between England and France for the Six Nations title. That owes much to Ireland's continued progress and the belief that Wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays. , who secured a first Triple Crown in 19 year last season, could go one better and win their first Five/Six Nations title since 1985. They start with away game against Italy and Scotland, before England and France come to Lansdowne Road. Their momentous victory over the Springboks can only bolster Ireland's self-belief, while Ronan O'Gara's late drop goal to deliver victory over Argentina wa further proof that Eddie O'Sullivan's side can now close out tight games. Not that England or France, who have won nine of the last 10 Six Nations title between them, will lay down quietly. dismantling of the Springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figure a Martin Johnson and Lawrence Dallaglio, they still have the personnel to prosper. The narrow defeat to Australia wa a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden, but the fresh shoot of post-World Cup recovery have been sown by new head coach Andy Robinson. A fresh desire to regain former height is evident, and if England emerge triumphant from an opening Six Nations engagement in Cardiff, a fourth title in six year is within reach. are in familiar revival territory, but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style. While South Africa's over-confidence in Cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected, Wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the All Blacks in one of the best Tests in recent memory. If Mike Ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack, there is no reason why victory should not ensue come February. The last fortnight ha left in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over Australia. A stunning defeat to Argentina, their first loss since the World Cup, could have been attributed to trademark French inconsistency. But the manner of New Zealand's 45-6 demolition job in Paris ha coach Bernard Laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard.

Millions to miss out on the net,"By 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still be without internet access at home, say a study. Around 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential service such a education and medical information, predicts the report by telecom giant BT. It compare to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes. The study call on the government and telecom industry to come up with new way to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday task move online and offline service become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts. The gap between ""have-nets"" and ""have-nots"" ha been much talked about, but prediction about how such a divide will affect future generation ha been less discussed. BT set out to predict future pattern based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. ""Internet access on other device tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote area have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""There is a hard rump of have-not who are not engaging with the net. They don't have the motivation or skill or perceive the benefits,"" said Mr Hosford. As now, the most disadvantaged group are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled. Those on low income will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such a BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco ha seen positive result with it Everybody Online project which offer internet access to people in eight deprived community around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high level of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skill to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific need of individual community is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. ""If we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunity will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said.

Web photo storage market hots up,"An increasing number of firm are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections. Digital camera were the hot gadget of Christmas 2004 and worldwide sale of the camera totalled $24bn last year. Many people's hard drive are bulging with photo and service which allow them to store and share their picture online are becoming popular. Search firm such a Google are also offering more complex tool for managing personal photo libraries. Photo giant such a Kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections, let user edit picture online and provides print-ordering services. Some services, such a Kodak's Ofoto and Snapfish, offer unlimited storage space but they do require user to buy some print online. Other sites, such a Pixagogo, charge a monthly fee. Marcus Hawkins, editor of Digital Camera magazine, said: ""As file size of picture increase, storage becomes a problem. ""People are using their hard drives, backing up on CD and DVD and now they are using online storage solutions. ""They are a place to store pictures, to share their picture with family and friend and they can print out their photos."" While many of the service are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer, other website are geared up for enthusiast who want to share tip and information. Photosig is an online community of photographer who can critique each other's work. On Tuesday, Google released free software for organising and finding digital photo stored on a computer's hard drive. The tool, called Picasa, automatically detects photo a they are added to a PC - whether sent via e-mail or transferred from a digital camera. The software includes tool for restoring colour and removing red eye, a well a sharpening images. Photos can then be uploaded to site such a Ofoto. Many people use the site to edit and improve their favourite photograph before ordering prints. Mr Hawkins added: ""The growth area is that you can order your print online. Friends and family can also access picture you want them to see and they can print them out too. ""Rather than just a place to dump your pictures, it's about sharing them."" The vast majority of picture remain on a PC's hard drive, which is why search tools, such a those offered by Google, become increasingly important.

Nintendo handheld given Euro date,"Nintendo's new handheld console, the DS, will launch in Europe on 11 March, the company ha announced. The portable game machine, which feature touch-screen control, will retail for Â£99 in the UK (149 euros). Nintendo said 15 game would be available in the UK at launch, with price ranging from Â£19 to Â£29. More than 2.8 million DS console have been sold since it first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony ha said it will launch it first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March. The PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite Sony's assertion that the machine are aimed at different consumers. The 15 game available on the European launch date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS, a well a title from third-party developer such a Ubisoft's Rayman DS. More than 120 game are in development for the new console, Nintendo ha said. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 game to be played. Additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the DS, with a ""download play"" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. Other feature include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega's launch title Project Rub. Nintendo ha also announced a medium adapter, which will allow the console to play music and video on the move. The launch price of Â£99 (149 euros) compare favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. ""It's a very, very competitive price point. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo ha created quite a buzz,"" he says. ""However, the line-up of game could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example."" Mr Houlihan belief that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony's new PSP, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed a a multimedia device. ""The PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Sony's attitude to the PSP ha been very understated in Europe, so far,"" Mr Houlihan said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analyst Screen Digest. In the past, game console and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other part of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company wa ""pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch"".

Bush to outline 'toughest' budget,"President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposal to date to the US Congress, seeking large cut in domestic spending to lower the deficit. About 150 federal program could be cut or axed altogether a part of a $2.5 trillion (Â£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit. Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposal exclude the cost of continuing military operation in Iraq. Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget wa the ""tightest"" so far. At the heart of the administration's fifth budget, presented to Congress on Monday, is an austere package of domestic measures. These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation. Such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increase of President Bush's first term. Mr Cheney admitted that the budget wa the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it wa ""fair and responsible"". ""It is not something we have done with a meat axe, nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society,"" he said. The war in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit. The shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005. Education, environmental protection and transport initiative are set to be scaled back a a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009. Most controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation's poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidy by $587m. Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase, although not by a much a originally planned. President Bush's proposal would see the Pentagon's budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn. The budget doe not include the cost of running military operation in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year. Also not featuring in the proposal is the cost of funding the administration's radical proposed overhaul of social security provision. Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period. Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both house of Congress, the proposal will be fiercely contested over the next few months. John McCain, a Republican Senator, said he wa pleased the administration wa prepared to tackle the deficit. ""With the deficit that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget,"" he said. However, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposal exposed the country to huge financial commitment beyond 2009.

Connors' rallying cry for British tennis,"""Do you have it in your heart? How much gut do you have? How much do you hate to lose?"" These are the question Jimmy Connors will be asking of Britain's brightest tennis hope in the months, and possibly years, to come. The American legend swept into London on Thursday to announce a ""long-term"" relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association after spending three day at the Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga. And the man who epitomised the phrase 'will to win' before Lleyton Hewitt wa even born is clear about the quality he hope to convey. ""You know, everybody hit the ball well and there's a very fine line between number one and number 100,"" said Connors. ""I wa that fine line for a long time. But if I can help, I want to be part of teaching kid how to win."" Connors is not the first great name to offer his service to the LTA - his long-time rival John McEnroe ha repeatedly done the same. But Connors is at pain to point out that his interest go well beyond any publicity stunt, and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of LTA performance director David Felgate and his team. ""Britain ha a different attitude, the right attitude, in taking the game forward and finding the next Wimbledon champion,"" said Connors. ""That's something you don't find every day. Everybody talk a good game but not everybody put that into effect. ""The impression I came away with after just seeing David and the other coach for three day wa one like I've never seen before, especially over here. ""This is not going to happen overnight, there are no miracle workers, but you're going in the right direction."" The 52-year-old's enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis official back in America. ""I've had discussion with the USTA (United States Tennis Association) over a number of years,"" he said. ""That's where it (my input) ended."" Connors is a straight-talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealing with the LTA and the cream of Britain's young players. ""If they're chosen, they've got to produce,"" he said. ""If not, someone will come and take their place. There's only one number one spot and it's lonely up there, but it's got the best view."" In the year that ha seen Andrew Murray emerge a Britain's great new hope, Connors rejected suggestion that the Scot might be put under too much pressure too soon. ""Tim Henman ha a whole country on his shoulder,"" said Connors. ""I don't know that pressure, but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level. ""Someone's going to have to come and take over from him (Henman). If I wa Andrew Murray, I'd embrace that. That's what we play for."" Despite the emphasis on hard work, training and preparation, Connors doe admit that the desire required of a champion ha to come from within. ""The passion I had, I don't know if you can find that,"" he admitted. ""I wa also nuts. I say that because there wa nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court.

Blind student 'hears in colour',"A blind student ha developed software that turn colour into musical note so that he can read weather maps. Victor Wong, a graduate student from Hong Kong studying at Cornell University in New York State, had to read coloured map of the upper atmosphere a part of his research. To study ""space weather"" Mr Wong needed to explore minute fluctuation in order to create mathematical models. A number of solution were tried, including having a colleague describe the map and attempting to print them in Braille. Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colour into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphic specialist and another student to do the programming work. ""The image have three dimension and I had to find a way of reading them myself,"" Mr Wong told the BBC News website. ""For the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientist generally - I felt it would be good to develop software that could help u to read colour images."" He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. The software then assigns one of 88 piano note to individually coloured pixel - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. Mr Wong say the application is still very much in it infancy and is only useful for reading image that have been created digitally. ""If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn't work that well."" Mr Wong ha been blind from the age of seven and he think that having a ""colour memory"" make the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. ""As the note increase in pitch I know the colour's getting redder and redder, and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears.""

Set your television to wow,"Television started off a a magical blurry image. Then came the sharpness, the colour and the widescreen format. Now the TV set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future, although those in Europe will have to be patient. After year of buzz about high-definition TV (HDTV) it is finally taking off in a handful of country around the world, mainly the US and Japan. If you believe the hype, then HDTV will so wow you, that you will never want to go back to your old telly. ""HDTV is just the latest must-have technology in viewers' homes,"" say Jo Flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the CBS network in the US. All television image are made up of pixels, going across the screen, and scan line going down. British TV picture are made up of 625 line and about 700 pixels. By contrast, HDTV offer up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. The result is a picture which can be up to six time a sharp a standard TV. But to get the full impact, programme need to be broadcast in this format and you need a HDTV set to receive them. Most new computer display are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. Viewers in Japan, the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea are already embracing the new TV technology, with a selection of primetime programme being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound. But TV viewer in Europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images. Many high-end European TV programmes, such a the recent Athens Olympics, are already being produced in high-definition. But they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. The prospect for getting sharper image soon do not seem very encouraging. According to consultant Strategy Analytics, only 12% of home in Europe will have TVs capable of showing programme in high-definition by 2008. But the HDTV hype spilling out of the US and Japan ha spurred European broadcaster and consumer electronic company to push for change. Big sport and entertainment event are set to help trigger the general public's attention. The 2006 World Cup in Germany will be broadcast in high-definition. In the UK, satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV service in 2006. There is already a HDTV service in Europe called Euro1080. Other European broadcasters, especially in France and Germany, also aiming to launch similar services. In Britain, digital satellite and cable are largely seen a the natural home for HDTV, at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. The communication watchdog Ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequency freed up when the UK switch off it analogue TV signal. For now, broadcaster like the BBC are working on their own HDTV plans, although with no launch date in sight. ""The BBC will start broadcasting in HDTV when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming,"" say Andy Quested, from the BBC's high-definition support group. ""We have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010, which would put u on the leading edge."" One of the option under consideration is to offer high-definition picture on the web. The BBC ha already dipped it toe into this, including some HDTV content in recent trial of it interactive medium player - a video player for PCs. It is planning to offer special release of selected flagship programme online in the near future. According to Mr Quested, this could help put Europe back into the running in the race to switch to HDTV.

Digital guru floats sub-$100 PC,"Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, say he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (Â£53). He told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be "" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood"". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device a a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, ""We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. ""The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processor and slower memory."" The device will probably be exported a a kit of part to be assembled locally to keep cost down. Mr Negroponte said this wa a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturer of the component would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen a predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiment in the US state of Maine, where child were given laptop computer to take home and do their work on. While the idea wa popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teacher and there were problem with laptop getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte ha adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two school together with his wife and gave the child laptops. ""We put in 25 laptop three year ago , only one ha been broken, the kid cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a game machine, not just a textbook.""

Golden rule 'intact' says ex-aide,"Chancellor Gordon Brown will meet his golden economic rule ""with a margin to spare"", according to his former chief economic adviser.

A question of trust and technology,"A major government department is without e-mail for a week, and technology analyst Bill Thompson want to know what happened. A couple of week ago I wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she wa offline for several days. It seems that thousand of civil servant at the UK's Department of Work and Pensions went through the same thing last week. It ha emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way, depriving staff of e-mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people's benefit and pension entitlement or note change in personal circumstances. Senior consultant from EDS, the computer firm which manage the system, and Microsoft, which supplied the software, were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all, while staff resorted to phone, fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done. Fortunately the back-office system which actually pay people their money were still working, so only new claim and update were affected done properly. This is bad enough for those affected, but it doe mean that the impact is not devastating for million of pensioners. I am sure regular reader will be expecting one of my usual diatribe against poor software, badly specified system and inadequate disaster recovery plans. Although the full story ha not yet been told, it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computer from Windows 2000 to Windows XP went wrong, and XP code wa inadvertently copied to thousand of machine across the network. This is certainly unfortunate, but I have a lot of sympathy for the network manager and technology staff involved. Today's computer network are large, complex and occasionally fragile. The interconnectedness that we all value also give u a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems. It is the network equivalent of Godel's Theorem - any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically. So I will reserve judgment on the technology aspect until we all know what actually happened and whether it wa a consequence of software failure or just bad luck. What is really disturbing, and cannot be excused, is the fact that it took four day for news of this system failure to leak out into the technical press. It is, without a doubt, a major story and wa the second or third lead item on BBC Radio 4's Today programme throughout Friday morning. So why did not the prime minister's official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefing before Friday? Why wa not the pension minister in Parliament to make an emergency statement on Tuesday, when it wa clear that there wa a serious problem? If there had been an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told, but it seems that major technology problem do not merit the same treatment. While EDS and Microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lesson to learn from their week of pain, we can learn some political lesson too. And the most important is that in this digital world, technology failure are matter of public interest, not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice, care or understand. That mean we need a full report on what went wrong and what wa done to fix it. It would be unacceptable for any of the party involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege. A major system ha evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently. Anything less is a betrayal of public trust.

It ha emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way, depriving staff of e-mails and access to the application software they use to calculate people's benefit and pension entitlement or note change in personal circumstances. Senior consultant from EDS, the computer firm which manage the system, and Microsoft, which supplied the software, were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all, while staff resorted to phone, fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done. Fortunately the back-office system which actually pay people their money were still working, so only new claim and update were affected done properly. This is bad enough for those affected, but it doe mean that the impact is not devastating for million of pensioners. I am sure regular reader will be expecting one of my usual diatribe against poor software, badly"

Stalemate in pension strike talks,"Talks aimed at averting national strike over pension reform have ended without agreement after 90 minutes. Five public sector union met Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at the Labour spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulation - due to be introduced in week - which would raise the pension age for council worker from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4 million worker could take part in strike earmarked for 23 March. Discussions will resume next week. A spokesman for Unison, Britain's biggest union, said after Saturday's meeting: ""At least we are still talking."" All side are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affair correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government worker on strikes. Other public sector union have pledged to follow. The five union which met Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow month of tough negotiation to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the change to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately minister believe this will be the ""less painful"" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkout unless there wa a government rethink. ""For a government that lecture everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector worker there is no choice,"" he said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five year - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable."" Unison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout.

Mike Prettejohn, president of Netcraft, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 November. He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week.

Child access law shake-up planned,"Parents who refuse to allow former partner contact with their child could be electronically tagged under plan being considered by ministers. Curfews and community service order were other option which could be used if court order to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affair secretary outlined some of the plan on Tuesday. He denied fathers' activist had forced the changes, telling the BBC ""there is a recognition that something is wrong"". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couple go to court to resolve access dispute each year, although in nine out of 10 separation there is no court intervention. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve dispute before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plan include: - Parenting plan to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life example that have worked in the past - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearing before contested court case - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet - Legal aid change to give incentive for early resolution of disputes. Judges can already jail parent who breach contact order but that wa a ""nuclear option"" which wa rarely used a it wa not seen a being in the child's interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation wa to provide a ""medium range"" of penalties, such a fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting class or curfews. Failure to comply with these measure could result in offender being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: ""Tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that."" Full detail of the new power will not be revealed until a bill is published ""in the next two weeks,"" a spokesman said. The government's proposal have met with disapproval from fathers' right groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: ""It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation."" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposal ""lacked compulsion"". ""We would like to see couple develop a plan and then have it a a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. ""Otherwise, you see people make agreement which then fall apart."" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children's Minister Margaret Hodge there wa not enough time to pas the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May. The Conservatives have called for an equal split between parent on access to be made law.

China had role in Yukos split-up,"China lent Russia $6bn (Â£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it ha been revealed. The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came a the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal see Rosneft receive $6bn in credit from China's CNPC. According to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credit would be used to pay off the loan Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision wa the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk's former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. ""The two company [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,"" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. ""There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years."" The announcement help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, wa able to finance it surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk wa sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid tax and fines. The embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of it main production arm. But Yugansk wa sold to a little known shell company which in turn wa bought by Rosneft. Yukos claim it downfall wa punishment for the political ambition of it founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country's richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion. The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen a part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supply to feed it booming economy. China's thirst for product such a crude oil, copper and steel ha helped pushed global commodity price to record levels. ""Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],"" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. ""They understand property right in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies."" ""If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,"" Mr Lukashov continued. ""And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it's a good deal for them too.""",business,"The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China.""The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,"" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan.The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks.The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy.The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead.China lent Russia $6bn (Â£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.",0.04482600732600734,"China lent Russia $6bn (Â£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it ha been revealed.

Media gadgets get moving,"Pocket-sized device that let people carry around video and image are set to have a big year in 2005, according to industry experts. Last year saw the emergence of portable medium players, such a the Windows-based Creative Zen portable medium player, the Samsung Yepp, the iRiver PMC-100, and the Archos AV400 series among others. But this year, they are set to get smarter and more connected, to allow people to find more video to watch on them. Archos launched it latest range of it Linux-based portable medium device at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Friday. Dubbed the Pocket Media Assistant PMA430, it crucially ha wi-fi capability built-in for the first time. ""Consumers are showing a great thirst for device that store all their medium in one place for anywhere access,"" said Henri Crohas, chief of Archos. ""And now those consumer can stay connected and productive at the same time."" Archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people's pockets, after the mobile. Unlike Windows-based players, the Archos AV400 series device have always been able to record from any video source, such a TVs, a well a playback. The content put onto the device is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device. Recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it. And wi-fi connectivity open up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link. Archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to Linux developer so that more application could be created for the device. Microsoft also made some announcement in the portable medium arena at CES, primarily for US consumer though. It ha agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company TiVo, which Bill Gates also showcased in his keynote speech at CES. The TiVo To Go service mean that US consumer will be able to take any programme they record on their TiVos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the Windows-based portable medium player or smartphones. It also said it had launched a service with MTV to let people watch Comedy Central, VH1 and Country Music TV on it devices. And a service is launching with MSN to provide people with shortened version of news, entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the PC onto the portable devices. But the ability to record directly from TV, VCR, and digital cable and satellite boxes, which Windows-based device do not offer, certainly give people more content to watch on the go too. The increased capability of these devices, and the content deal that are being done, may go some way to persuading people to use them. Recent research by Jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that wa dedicated to music. Only 13% of Europeans wanted to watch video while on the move. More seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices. ""This year, we are ready for an explosion of portable media,"" Microsoft's Mike Coleman told the BBC News website. ""We are very bullish about it. The fact that I can put photo on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer,"" he added. The fact that Europeans are far larger public transport user than Americans is one reason why portable medium will take off in the coming year too. There is a burgeoning market there for commuter to watch news and other programme on their way to work. Although Microsoft's content distribution deal are for the US market at the moment, talk were ""always on-going"" with European content supplier to offer similar services. Various right management issue have to be ironed out first however.

Brits debate over 'urban' music,"Joss Stone, a 17-year-old soul singer from Devon, beat Dizzee Rascal, Jamelia, Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards. Her victory ha reignited the debate about what urban music is. I'm not really comfortable with the word urban. It's a word that's been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music. The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it's wrong. How far are the Brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing? It's so far removed that I don't expect them to get it bang on. The music industry isn't championing music from our particular genre very well anyway. People don't feel like that's anything to do with us. I don't feel like urban music's just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the Brits acknowledging that there's an urban music scene because it's all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day. It's not really relevant. If Joss Stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she look like and how she sound and who she's signed to, then so be it. It's got nothing to do with what's really going on. Urban a a genre is very broad. If you look underneath urban, there are a number of core element that include hip-hop, R&B, garage and into that obviously come soul. Joss Stone is a soul artist. Her first album wa called The Soul Sessions. So urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres, and there are offshoot of all of those. Joss Stone ha had amazing success [in the US] given that she's a UK artist. What ha really captured everybody's imagination is that here you have a 17-year-old from Devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really, really good tune and she look good - I think that's what's done it. The award for best British urban act wa voted for by viewer of MTV Base. I don't think Joss wa not a worthy winner. She make soul music and that definitely come under the category of what we describe a urban. The fact that she's from Devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large city and she's literally rural. The great thing about urban music is that there's a big range. If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain, I think that's where you can call it urban - that's where this new sub-category, or uber-category, ha come from. Joss Stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experience of an older soul singer, but you couldn't argue that she wa being inauthentic with her emotion - it is coming from somewhere genuine. It ha to come across a real. That's the only cut-off point we have here and that's the only way by which we judge people. What urban mean to u a an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background. Music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi-cultural Britain, then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion. If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think act from other ethnicity doing classical music and rock should be accepted too. Race doesn't make a difference if everyone is included. Out of all the award dished out yesterday, I'm still trying to find out what people of other race received any sort of recognition or award. A type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life. She might not be urban, but when did R&B become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? R&B stand for Rhythm And Blues, remember! That Joss Stone is rubbish is certain. If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (I think probably should include Hip-Hop, Soul & Funk at least but not rock or pop) this year it the Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stake a good claim She definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stone's album are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that wa released last year. This whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artist who weren't nominated or didn't win. I cant see why people can't just congratulate her for the talent that she is. She did deserve it, but I agree with the comment about urban music. Its a stupid phrase, and particularly British. In the state they tend to use hip hop and R&B, if I say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what I'm talking about. Very strange. What's in a name? A rose by any other name etc... If people want to call it urban, why not? If we really analysed it, the term 'dance music' is misleading because it doesn't describe everything you can dance to. Whilst I agree that the term 'urban' is open to interpretation, it strike me a simply weird that Joss Stone ha won. 'Urban' to me is what I hear being played in party in the inner city - I live in Brixton and have never heard The Soul Sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any party I've been to. Good luck to Joss Stone, let's celebrate her victory - let's also question why, with artist so successful and talented a Jamelia, Lemar, Kanye West, Dizzee Rascal, Alicia Keys and Outkast - we didn't see a single black artist on stage collecting an award. So, what you're saying is that any music that ha black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn't black. And, if it is, then they shouldn't be acknowledged for it even if they're pretty dam good at it? She's 17, ha an amazing voice, and won. Good on her. Oh, but she's not ""black"" well, let's make her feel real bad about it then. How dare she! Though hang on, didn't the so-called 'public' vote on this one? This idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what wa happening in the 1940s and 50 in relation to what ""Jazz"" was. The medium then called anything that had a swinging beat, syncopated melody or soulful feeling ""Jazz"", much to the chagrin of the artists. It would mean that ""blues"" would be put in the same mould a ""bebop"", ""cool"" and ""ragtime"", all very different style at that time. Jazz wa and remains such a massively misunderstood term. And so what of ""Urban"" music? In truth it's a lazy term to categorise music that you don't really understand. Soul and garage are world apart musically (Marvin Gaye v Tuff Jam?), but no doubt have their connections. If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of award won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents. I demand a prize for rural music! Sucks to the cities- it's way better out here. We have hay, for one thing. Excluding her from what ha become known a urban music would be a bad a excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely? I dont understand the point that Ty is making. If Lemar, who make music which is less soulful than Joss' work won, he might have said nothing. (btw i'm black too) How can she be ""urban"" if she spent most of her life in the Devon countryside? Nonsense. I love Joss to bit and don't care what her branding is - it's amazing music, full stop. Stop puting it all in bracket and let's just call it music, and let's especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin, this just set an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour. Surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artist that are making what is (historically) considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from. Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just a someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music. If that person wa good at it and authentic in sound, would we criticise it being referred to a country music or the artist for representing that style? The term urban in reference to a music genre in UK ha developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards. The very term 'Music of Black Origin' ha confused and offended many people. This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards. It appears that the use of 'black' or 'white' in relation to music make people feel uncomfortable. The term 'urban' therefore, ha been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first 'black' or 'white' thereby rendering the issue colourblind. The result is now a redundant new debate a to what 'urban' also means. Perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strain of soul/RnB and Hip-Hop, one which doe not also mean something else - a we have done with 'Crunk'. Urban is just a word that's come about recently to describe ""black"" music that's become popular now. The word wasn't even in use, or common use five of six year ago. It's just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music, because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it. I'm in a band that ha been called ""urban"", and I despise the label. I'd hate to think I belonged to any neat marketing niche, because that's all it is. Ever since the music channel and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider 'music of black origin', these label have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity. Look at all the TV broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some 'urban' music on the soundtrack a if it some dreadful cheap lift music. Ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music. As a black man, I think I agree with some of the statement at least the statement made by the key executives. Black people should lead the music they invented . We should stop calling a genre meaningless, northing is meaningless. The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she wa doing if she were black? Same thing, with Streets, Amy Winehouse, etc. Who's ever heard of Terri Walker or Rhian Benson.. They are both 10 time better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos , but why not Brits???? So what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards. Her music is great soul and surely that is under the 'Urban' banner? What if The Streets had won? Would people be whining because Mike Skinner is white... It seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else. Urban is PC version for saying black music. I'm not doubting Ms Stone's talent, but why didn't Jamelia or Lemar get a Brit? This reminds me of what happened to Craig David and Soul II Soul in the past, getting nomination are easy to get, but picking up a Brit seems to be the hardest thing. Refreshing to see people making reasonable, intelligent comment on any topic these days. More power to you, people! You have said it: there is music you like and music you don't like - who care what label you put on it? That entire category wa a mess. How can you have people like Dizzee Rascal up against Joss Stone? Its like putting Eminem against Bob Geldof. She should have been nominated for Best British R & B act. Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don't think it wa very 'urban' of her to sing angel with Robbie Williams. Urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin? Well doesn't that include rock? Music made in the inner cities? Well almost all band end up making music in London/Manchester etc. And doesn't that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? It doesn't make any sense. Why doe music have to be put into a genre? It's music, you like it or you don't. Simple a that. I play in a heavy metal band. We are urban music a far a I'm concerned. We live in city and spend our working life in an urban environment; It therefore directly shape what we write musically. ""Urban"" seems to be the new name for all style of black music. Why it needed a rebrand I don't know a the name is misleading. Oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know, therefore more than fit the term ""urban"" yet a they're a white rock band they won't be described a such. Joss Stone ha a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the Brit? All this ""urban"" and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored. Yeah, she deserved it. She is talented. Urban is a crap, meaningless, politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though.

Muslim police stops 'more likely',"UK Muslims should accept that people of Islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police, a Home Office minister ha said. Hazel Blears said innocent Muslims would be targeted because of the search for Islamic extremists. Qualifications for religious leader to enter the UK could also be made tougher, she told a Commons inquiry. Her comment have been described a ""irresponsible"" and ""outrageous"" by the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC). ""The threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of Islam, or who are falsely hiding behind Islam,"" the Salford MP told the Commons home affair committee. ""It mean that some of our counter-terrorism power will be disproportionately experienced by the Muslim community."" It wa a reality that should be recognised, she said. ""If a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area,"" she added. On minister of religions, such a imams, she said faith group would be asked what other qualification and skills, such a civic knowledge and ability to engage the community, should be demanded. Last year, minister introduced a requirement that minister should speak English to a certain level. IHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused Ms Blears of ""playing an Islamophobia card"" in the run-up to a general election. ""She is demonising and alienating our community,"" he said. ""It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racist to have an onslaught on our community. ""This sort of comment is just music to the ear of racists."" Later, the prime minister's official spokesman urged people to put Ms Blears' comment into context. The minister had been saying she understood there wa a perception that stop and search wa aimed at one community, but that wa not what wa happening, the spokesman said. ""What is happening is that those power are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community. ""It is not aimed at a particular community, it is not police policy to aim these power at a particular community,"" he added. Statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist act in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic background were known were Muslim, he added Figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minority were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics. Figures showed that, for 2003/2004, Asians were 1.9 time more likely to be stopped and searched, compared with 1.7 time more likely in the previous year.

Muslim group have repeatedly claimed that their community are being victimised under terror laws. In 2003/2004, 12.5% search under the law were on Asian people, even though they make up 4.7% of the population.

Asia quake increases poverty risk,"Nearly two million people across Asia could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) ha said. In it first overview of the disaster, the ADB said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major city and factory escaped damage. But the blow to many low-income people could be ""enormous"". The Paris Club of rich creditor nation on Wednesday offered to freeze debt owed by tsunami-hit countries. The move wa aimed at helping South Asian government find budget to rebuild devastated coastal areas, though so far only Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Seychelles have indicated that they will take it up. Other country believe their economy are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed a credit risks. ""Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster,"" said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali. Donor nation have promised to give $717m (Â£379m) in disaster relief over the next six months, according to the United Nations. Mr Ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledge must be promptly delivered, saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on ""concerns over sanitation and health conditions, and other basic needs"" being ""properly and quickly addressed"". There are 1.9 billion people in Asia living on less than $2 a day. The ADB fear that 1 million Indonesians could join them, while in India just over half a million people - 645,000 - are at risk of falling into poverty. A quarter of a million Sri Lankans and 23,500 people in the Maldives are also facing poverty. In the Maldives, where 43% of the population already life on less than $2 a day, this could rise to half. Sri Lanka and the Maldives are the two country the ADB fear are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami. Sri Lanka's government ha estimated reconstruction cost at nearly $3bn. A government task force held meeting to discus an emergency rebuilding plan with the ADB, World Bank and Japanese aid agency on Wednesday, and promised to publish the plan within 10 days. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs. Although Indonesia's northern province of Aceh suffered the worst death toll, the region's oil and natural gas production facility ""have survived intact"", the report said. However, it remains too soon to ass the damage to poor people's livelihood in Aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater. ""This is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the million who are suffering. But the economy of the affected country except Sri Lanka and the Maldives should emerge with minimal damage,"" the ADB report said. Some business may even gain from the reconstruction efforts, thereby creating jobs. At a meeting in Thailand, ABD president Thadao Chino said he wa confident of the country's ""own capability to restore normalcy to the affected area and meet the rehabilitation requirements"". Thailand ha said it doe not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze, while India ha also rejected international aid, saying it can cope on it own resources.

PC photo printers challenge pros,"Home printed picture can be cheaper and higher quality than those from High Street developers, test shows. A survey carried out by PC Pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printer offered a better deal than handing your snap to a photo lab. The test found that image from top PC printer kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs. But using the wrong printer cartridge could mean snap fade in months, warned the magazine. The group test of 100 home photo printer for PCs discovered how much it cost to create image using the device compared to online developer a well a High Street name such a Jessops, Boots and Snappy Snaps. The comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printer produced images, the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished picture were to smudging or water damage. It found that although some ink for printer now cost more than Â£2 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce print from photograph at home than it is to send them off to a High Street store. ""If you really like your photos, then it's definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street, but only if you choose the right printer,"" said Nick Ross, top tester at PC Pro. Mr Ross said that a new generation of printer produced image with brighter colour and that were less likely to fade than many High Street developer or even some professional wedding photographers. Some High Street photo shop can be the cheapest when it came to developing print that were 6x4in, said Mr Ross, but the test revealed that image 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home. According to PC Pro, producing a print 8x10in on an Epson R800 printer using top quality paper cost Â£1.87. At Jessops the same image would cost Â£2.50 and at Snappy Snaps Â£9.99. A 10x7in snap at Boots would cost Â£4.99. ""Considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the High Street and how silver-halide print can fade in the sun, we're adamant that it's now better, cheaper and more convenient to print at home,"" he said. Ann Simpson, marketing manager at Snappy Snaps belief the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers. ""Some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to u is that customer often have to print two or three picture at home in order to get a good one,"" she said. ""Many people are not skilled at getting the colour, contrast and cropping right and they don't want the hassle,"" she added.

Ireland 19-13 England,"Ireland consigned England to their third straight Six Nations defeat with a stirring victory at Lansdowne Road. A second-half try from captain Brian O'Driscoll and 14 point from Ronan O'Gara kept Ireland on track for their first Grand Slam since 1948. England scored first through Martin Corry but had ""tries"" from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey disallowed. Andy Robinson's men have now lost nine of their last 14 match since the 2003 World Cup final. The defeat also heralded England's worst run in the championship since 1987. Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 year on they share top spot in the table on maximum point with Wales. And Eddie O'Sullivan's side banished the ghost of 2003 when England were rampant 42-6 victor in claiming the Grand Slam at Lansdowne Road. In front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in Dublin, Ireland tore into the white-shirted visitor from the kick-off and made their intention clear when O'Gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal. England took their time to settle but their first real venture into Ireland's half produced a simple score for Corry. The number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jersey between himself and the Irish line, racing 25 yard to touch down. England fly-half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately O'Gara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalty in quick succession. England were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and Hodgson, the villain at Twickenham, coolly bisected the posts. The first quarter wa marked by period of tactical kicking, but it wa Ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. A series of probe led by the talismanic O'Driscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch. From the line-out, the ball wa recycled back to O'Gara, who stroked his second drop-goal, this time off the right upright. As the interval approached, wing Josh Lewsey wa the catalyst for England's most promising attack. The Wasps star raced up his touchline and Hodgson's cross-kick put in Mark Cueto for an apparent score, but the Sale wing wa ruled to have started in front of the kicker. England began the second half well and had Ireland pinned in their own half. But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break-out awarded O'Gara a kick at goal, which he missed. England's pressure continued, and a wave of attack saw centre Jamie Noon dragged down yard from the line before Hodgson landed a drop-goal. The lead wa shortlived, however. Ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from Geordan Murphy on Hodgson, ending with O'Driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. O'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine point clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson's cross-kick wa fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line. Anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high, but O'Gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. Inside the last 10 minutes, England poured forward, spurred on by scrum-half Matt Dawson, who replaced Leicester's Harry Ellis. But despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the TV replay by referee Jonathan Kaplan - England were unable to pull off a face-saving win. Ireland next face France at Lansdowne Road in two weeks' time before the potential title decider against Wales in Cardiff. England are still to meet Italy at Twickenham, in what is now a wooden spoon decider, and Scotland.

Jones files Conte lawsuit,"Marion Jones ha filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco bos Victor Conte following his allegation that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs. The Sydney Olympic gold medallist say Conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (Â£13m) in the suit. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claim in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: ""I stand by everything I said"". Jones won three gold medal and two bronze in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she ""has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs"".

Toxic web links help virus spread,"Virus writer have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares. A Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machine into distributor of it malicious code. Those clicking on the poisoned link in e-mail message sent out by infected machine may fall victim to the virus. The trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti-virus software that comb through code contained in e-mail attachments. The virus that us this trick is called Bofra and the first member of the family of worm appeared on 10 November. They exploit a Windows vulnerability that wa discovered only a few day earlier. Like many other recent viruses, Bofra plunder the address book in Microsoft Outlook for e-mail address and scour other file on an infected machine for fresh target addresses. The virus us it own mail sending software to despatch e-mail message to potential victim but, unlike many other recent viruses, doe not itself travel via mail. Instead the body of the mail message sent out contain fake weblinks that, when clicked on, connect back to the machine that distributed that e-mail.

The message try to trick people into clicking on the link by promising pornographic video and image or by posing a payment confirmation for a Paypal transaction. Copies of the message seen by the BBC News website had bright yellow and green backgrounds. Those clicking on the link will inadvertently download the Bofra virus which will then start searching for new address to send itself to. Filtering firm Clearswift said this tactic of creating thousand of mini web server wa designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempt to shut it down. In the past other malicious program have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines. Shutting down this central server usually stop the virus spreading. Clearswift said that fact that no viral code travel in the e-mail message sent out by machine infected by Bofra could hamper effect to limit it spread. Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copy of the Bofra virus and it variant in circulation. Tim Warner, spokesman for anti-virus firm Finjan, said: ""You have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating."" Mr Warner said organisation needed to prepare deep defence to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code.

China suspends 26 power projects,"China ha ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds. The move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supply for it booming economy. Last year 24 province suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 project had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list wa a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. ""Construction of these project ha started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal project of construction first, approval next,"" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website. Some of the project may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 project halted. Other project included a petrochemical plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list wa made up of new power plants, with some extension to existing ones. The stoppage would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control project licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdown have tended to focus on project for which the government argued there wa overcapacity, such a steel and cement. The government ha encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortage which forced many factory onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased it generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatt (MW). The biggest single project to be halted wa the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' a the upper reach of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power station being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant. The Three Gorges Dam ha proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It ha drawn criticism from environmental group and overseas human right activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze ha also begun to attract criticism from environmentalist in China. In April 2004, central government official ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which cover the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known a the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists.

Labour's core support takes stock,"Tony Blair ha told Labour supporter he's ""back"" and still hungry for the job of prime minister - but doe that sum up the mood at the party's spring conference in Gateshead? ""The electorate are keener on the government than some Labour Party members,"" is the dry assessment of Graham Lane, leader of the Labour group on Newham Council. The problem, according to Mr Lane, is not continuing division over Iraq, foundation hospital or tuition fees, or even voter apathy, but Mr Blair himself. ""I have a new slogan. Vote Blair, Get Brown. That's what I am telling people on the doorstep. Don't worry, he will be gone soon."" His friend, Saxon Spence, leader of Devon county Labour group, lay the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others. ""You cannot underestimate the impact of the war in Iraq. We lost people from our local party who had some key roles."" But the two friend were fired up by Gordon Brown's speech on Saturday, with it appeal to core Labour value on social justice, health and education. ""There wa real passion. I think we have all felt a little jaded, but it reminded u why we joined the party in the first place,"" said Mrs Spence. ""If he hadn't have walked off the stage, they would still be clapping,"" added Mr Lane. But for every Brownite at the spring conference there wa an equally ardent fan of Mr Blair.

Katrina Bull, a prospective parliamentary candidate said Mr Blair had shown he could rouse the party's grassroots: ""I think if every voter wa able to spend time in a room with Tony, the way we have today, we will have no problem with turnout."" She had just emerged from a Q&A session, in which Mr Blair - tieless and supremely at ease - answered question posed via the party's website. A party of councillor from Nottingham agreed that there wa nothing wrong with Mr Blair's leadership - and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city wa a strong a ever. Iraq, they insisted, would not be a factor for most voters. ""The biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these poll saying we are going to run away with the election. ""It might sound great, but it doe create this sense of complacency among our own voter and I think that is the greater problem than Iraq,"" said Nottingham City Councillor Brian Parbutt. And even Mr Blair's most vocal critic seemed to agree on one thing - he is a master of the sort of glossy, high-profile campaigning that ha become Labour's hallmark, epitomised by Friday's whistle-stop tour of marginal seats. A group of shop steward from the Swan Hunter shipyard, who said they were facing redundancy, could barely suppress their anger at Mr Blair's failure to, a they saw it, shake off his Tory leaning and stand up for manufacturing in the North East. They were also scathing about the alleged benefit of showpiece project such a conference venue Sage Centre, heralded by John Prescott and others this weekend a a symbol of Labour's success in urban regeneration. ""It is no good having the Sage or Baltic if you haven't got the money for the entrance fee,"" said Terry Telford.

We are up for this election,"" said Richie Porterhouse.

Talks aim to avert pension strike,"Talks aimed at averting a series of national strike over pension reform will take place this weekend. Five public sector union will hold private talk with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at Labour's spring conference in Gateshead. They want the government to withdraw regulation - due to be introduced in week - which would raise the pension age for council worker from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m worker could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all side are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affair correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain's biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government worker on strikes. Other public sector union have pledged to follow. It is just week before new regulation are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers. The five union meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow month of tough negotiation to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the change to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately minister believe this will be the ""less painful"" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkout unless there wa a government rethink. ""For a government that lecture everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector worker there is no choice,"" he said. ""If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five year - that is working until people drop. ""In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.""

EU rules 'won't stop UK spending',"The shape of the UK's economy In graphic But he denied that he wa ruling out British membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic test this year. Mr Brown said that it wa vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future. Otherwise it would be overtaken by the like of China, he told MPs. The chancellor said that the EU's planned change in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that country in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle. Under Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted a part of that deficit. He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rule ""make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programme that are necessary to improve it infrastructure"". But he argued that the EU wa moving in the direction of the UK principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficit over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt a well a the balance each year. Under Mr Brown's ""sustainable investment"" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact. Mr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claim that he had in effect fiddled the figure to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified Â£3.4bn of spending on road repair a public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only Â£6bn. Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter. But the chancellor said Mr Fallon wa ""impugning the integrity"" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. Mr Brown also denied that he wa increasing tax to fund his spending gap. He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profit for company which would boost Treasury coffers. Earlier, ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rule governing the euro zone. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more ""rigid"" rules. But fellow Tory David Heathcoat-Amory said the folly of the system wa in trying to run Europe's varied economy on one set of rules. ""The essential point here is that the stability and growth pact ha turned out to be a fake,"" he said. ""The warning is about the European constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rule in a constitution. It give more power to Brussels to co-ordinate thing like employment and economic policy."" But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rule were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. ""The condition for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,"" Mr. Brown said.",politics,"""The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,"" Mr. Brown said.The chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership.Under Mr Brown's ""sustainable investment"" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future.But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was ""impugning the integrity"" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently.Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more ""rigid"" rules.Under Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit.Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter.",0.11313131313131314,"The shape of the UK's economy In graphic But he denied that he wa ruling out British membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic test this year.

O'Sullivan keeps his powder dry,"When you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential. Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season's Six Nations Championship. He decreed after the 2003 World Cup that player should have a decent conditioning period during the year. That became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season. It may have annoyed his Scottish, and in particularly Welsh, cousin who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the Celtic League. We will say nothing of Mike Ruddock ''poaching'' eight of the Dragons side that faced Leinster on Sunday. But, like O'Sullivan, he wa well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that go along with it. The IRFU ha thrown their weight behind O'Sullivan, who must be glad that in the main, there is centrally-controlled contracts. Bar Keith Gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg, everyone of O'Sullivan's squad is fit, fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season's campaign. But I doubt whether O'Sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players. He is not that sort of person. However, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit England, Wales and France squad whose player have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight. But there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive result when the referee signal the start of the game. Already Ireland are being earmarked a hot favourite in many quarter to go the whole hog this season. A first Grand Slam since Karl Mullen's led the team to a clean sweep in 1948. With England and France visiting Lansdowne Road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything look perfectly placed. But in the day of yore that frightened the life out of any Irishman. Under the burden of great expectations, Ireland have crumpled. Take the Triple Crown-winning side of 1985 under Mick Doyle. They were expected to up the ante further for a Grand Slam, only the second in Ireland's history. What happened in 1986? Whitewashed. You see, Ireland, in any sport, love to be downsized. Then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary. It is the nature of the beast. But O'Sullivan's side are very capable of proving a salient point this season. After their first Triple Crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder. O'Sullivan ha kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spade ... and there is more to come.

Blinx sequel purrs nicely,"The original Blinx wa intended to convert many platform game lover to Microsoft's then new Xbox console. Its sharp graphic and novel gameplay, with the main character able to pause, slow, rewind and fast-forward time, were meant to lure many fan to the new machine.

Thankfully, the sequel ha fixed many of the original faults. This time around you do not play a Blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat character and two pig characters. The character generator is very detailed and a few minute of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game.

There are a number of puzzle which require control over time to solve while the pig can create thing such a warps, space bubble and void trap in order to progress. The control over space and time is achieved through a number of VCR-style icon and is quite intuitive. Annoyingly, the puzzle are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them. The game ha also tried to emulate franchise such a Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank on PS2 and so there are a number of combat elements. These are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair.

Nintendo DS aims to touch gamers,"The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile device offering a range of gaming and other feature such a movie and music playback. Market leader Nintendo, however, is releasing a handheld console that it say will revolutionise the way game are played. The first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks. Far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it look more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. The lightweight clam shell device open up to reveal two screens, and when switched on it instantly reveals it pedigree. Both screen are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. Nintendo ha given developer free rein to utilise the dual screen and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen. The Japanese gaming giant hope the DS will maintain the firm's pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market. Nintendo first launched it GameBoy console in 1989 and ha dominated the market ever since. But it lead can no longer be taken for granted. Sony will enter the market later this year with it PlayStation Portable, while start-up company Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. ""We believe the DS will appeal to all ages, both gender and gamers of any skill,"" said David Yarnton, Nintendo Europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. With it two screens, wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance, the DS certainly ha a number of unique selling points. It went on sale in the US in mid-November priced $150 and Nintendo say sale have exceeded expectations, without giving detailed figures. Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. With more than two million pre-orders for the device in Japan, Nintendo is confident it will keep it number one spot. But will the device prove to be a revolutionary a claimed? The game ship with a demo of Metroid Hunters - a 3D action title which can be played alone or with a group of friend using the machine's wireless capabilities. It certainly look impressive on the small machine and play smoothly even with a group of people. The game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offer a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. It is certainly a unique control method and while it make aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. Super Mario 64 DS is a faithful re-creation of the Nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. The game look stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. One thing is for certain.

Be careful how you code,"A new European directive could put software writer at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson. If it get it way, the Dutch government will conclude it presidency of the European Union by pushing through a controversial measure that ha been rejected by the European Parliament, lack majority support from national government and will leave million of European citizen in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court case against them. If the new law wa about border controls, defence or even the new constitution, then our TV screen would be full of expert agonising over the impact on our daily lives. Sadly for those who will be directly affected, the controversy concern the patenting of computer programs, a topic that may excite the bloggers, campaigning group and technical press but doe not obsess Middle Britain. After all, how much fuss can you generate about the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions, and the way it amends Article 52 of the 1973 European Patent Convention? Yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the EU's ministerial councils, a seems likely, it will allow program to be patented in Europe just a they are in the US. Many observer of the computing scene, including myself, think the result will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmer and the free and open source software movement. It will let large company patent all sort of idea and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas. In the US you cannot build a system that store customer credit card detail so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless Amazon let you, because they hold the patent on ""one-click"" online purchase. It is a small invention, but Amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it. We are relatively free from this sort of thing over here, but perhaps not for long. The new proposal go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented invention ha been going on since at least the mid-1980s. They have come to a head now after a year in which proposal were made, endorsed by the Council of Ministers, radically modified by the European Parliament and then re-presented in their original form. Some national government seem to be aware of the problems. Poland ha rejected the proposal and Germany's main political party have opposed it, but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. Early in December the British government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. Science Minister Lord Sainsbury went along to listen and outline the UK position, but according to those present, it wa embarrassing to see how little the minister and his official actually understood the issue concerned. The draft Directive is being put through the council a what is called an ""A"" item and can only be approved or rejected. No discussion or amendment is allowed. So why should we be worried? First, there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the view of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. This go to the heart of the European project, and even those who do not care about software or patent should be worried. If coder are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow? More directly, once software patent are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent. This is not about stealing software, a code is already protected by copyright. Patents are not copyright, but something much stronger. A patent give the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other person invented it separately. I have never, to my shame, managed to read Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. If it wa pointed out that one of my article contained a substantial chunk of the poem then I could defend myself in court by claiming that I had simply made it up and it wa coincidence. The same doe not hold for a patent. If I sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphic compression routine and it happens to be the same a the LZW algorithm used in GIF files, then I am in trouble under patent law, at least in the US. Coincidence is no defence. The proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are US-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. They have legal department and, more crucially, patent of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders. Even this system break down, of course, a Microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by Eolas which claimed that Internet Explorer (and other browsers) infringed an Eolas patent. That one wa eventually thrown out, but only after month of uncertainty and million of dollars. But small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patent to trade. Much of the really useful software we use every day, program like the Apache web server, the GNU/Linux operating system and the fearsomely popular Firefox browser, is developed outside company structure by people who do not have legal department to check for patent infringements. The damage to software will not happen overnight, of course. If the directive go through it ha to be written into national law and then there will be a steady stream of legal action against small company and open source products. Eventually someone will decide to attack Linux directly, probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. The new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmer to spend time checking for patent infringement or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. And it will damage Europe's computer industry. We can only hope that the Council of Ministers ha the integrity and strength to reject this bad law.

Wales silent on Grand Slam talk,"Rhys Williams say Wales are still not thinking of winning the Grand Slam despite a third Six Nations win. ""That's the last thing on our mind at the moment,"" said Williams, a second- half replacement in Saturday's 24-18 win over France in Paris. ""We all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to Scotland and beat them. ""We've come unstuck there a couple of time recently so our focus is on that game and we'll worry about Ireland hopefully after we've beaten Scotland."" With captain Gareth Thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb, Williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far. Kevin Morgan is probably favourite to replace Thomas at full-back, leaving Williams and Hal Luscombe to battle for the right wing berth. A hamstring injury denied Luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start, but the Dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to Murrayfield on 13 March.

Choose hope over fear - Kennedy,"Voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election, said Charles Kennedy. In his New Year message the Liberal Democrat leader said Labour and the Conservatives were united in relying on fear and ""populist scares"". He said his party wa the one of hope and wa ready for a 2005 poll. On the Asian tsunami he said it had been ""very heartening"" to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons. Mr Kennedy said his thought were with all those caught up in the disaster, which had dominated the Christmas and New Year period. At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats a they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.

He said the government wa using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties. It wa already using detention without trial at Belmarsh Prison, ignoring a recent Law Lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights, he said. He also criticised attempt to bring in trial without jury, plan to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of right to protest, increased stop and search power and ID card plans. He said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. ""But at the same time, an overmighty state is a dangerous one,"" he said. His party ""instinctively"" understood the ""new liberal Britain"" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said. ""We are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality. ""Our national institution are changing too.

Standard Life cuts policy bonuses,"Standard Life, Europe's largest mutual life insurer, ha cut bonus for with-profit policyholders. Annual bonus rate on it with-profits life policy were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonus on pension policy were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. It is the sixth time in three year Standard Life ha made cut to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. The insurer blamed the cut on poor share return and low interest rates. With-profits policy are designed to smooth out the peak and trough of stock market volatility. Profits made in good year are kept in reserve to pay investor an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. Slumping share price throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firm to trim bonus rate on their policies. Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investment during 2001 and 2002.

Bellamy fined after row,"Newcastle have fined their Welsh striker Craig Bellamy two weeks' wage - about Â£80,000 - following his row with manager Graeme Souness. But Bellamy, 25, ha not been put on the transfer list, although he did not train with the first team on Tuesday. Magpies chairman Freddy Shepherd told the Newcastle Evening Chronicle: ""It is not about money. It is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club. ""No individual is, be it the chairman, the manager or a player."" Souness dropped Bellamy for Sunday's game against Arsenal, claiming the Welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position. ""When I heard what the manager wa saying I wa in shock,"" Bellamy said. ""I thought 'not only ha he gone behind my back, he's lying',"" he said in response to Souness' remarks. And the Wales international refused to apologise. ""I won't apologise because I have done nothing wrong,"" he told the Evening Chronicle. ""There's no doubt about it, I am out of here."" The difficult relationship between Souness and Bellamy boiled over at the weekend, and ha led to a war of word in the media. Bellamy's claim that Souness had lied about the background to the bust-up wa strongly denied by Shepherd, who accused the striker of ""cheating"" the club. ""I wish to put the record straight regarding the Bellamy situation,"" said Shepherd. ""Craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring wa tight (on Friday), but what he failed to reveal wa that he had told other member of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury. ""When Graeme discovered this he immediately ordered Bellamy to attend a meeting in my office. ""At that meeting Bellamy admitted to Graeme and I that he had told the player that he wa going to ""fake"" an injury in training and walk off. ""He also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team-mates for his behaviour. He didn't do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend, which I fully support. ""In my book this is cheating on the club, the supporters, the manager and his own team-mates. ""He is paid extremely well and I consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional."" Bellamy's latest outburst would appear to make his chance of a first-team recall remote. But even before Newcastle said the player would not be sold, Bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request. ""I don't want the fan to think for one minute that I wouldn't play for this club,"" he said. ""I'd play anywhere for this club, even in goal. ""It's a very difficult situation for me at the moment but I'd never ask to leave this club. ""This club mean so much to me. I couldn't do it because I know I couldn't come back here and play against Newcastle.

Finding new homes for old phones,"Re-using old mobile phone is not just good for the environment, it ha social benefit too. Research ha found that in some developing nation old mobile phone can help close the digital divide. The Forum for the Future research found that the low cost of these recycled handset mean they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. But the Forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phone rather than let them rot in landfill sites. The report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phone go out of use every year in the UK. Of the 15 million that are swapped for newer model each year, only 25% get returned to mobile phone firm for recycling or re-use. The slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phone ha now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonne of waste, estimate James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future. ""It's quite common for people to have two or three phone just lying around,"" said Mr Goodman. Many of these older phone could end up in landfill site leaking the potentially toxic material they are made of into the wider world, said Mr Goodman. Far better, he said, to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. ""We've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back,"" said Mr Goodman, ""but there's a strong social argument too.""

""It's an interesting country because it ha a really crap fixed line network,"" said Mr Goodman, ""and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones."" But the relatively low wage in Romania, which is one of the poorest country in Europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone.

For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturer claim ha undervalued the yuan by a much a 40% - ha given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors. Meanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods.

Savvy searchers fail to spot ads,"Internet search engine user are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated, suggests a report into search habits. The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87% of searcher usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. It also show that few can spot the difference between paid-for result and organic ones. The report reveals that 84% of net user say they regularly use Google, Ask Jeeves, MSN and Yahoo when online. Almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engine much less, if they knew information about who paid for result wa being hidden. According to figure gathered by the Pew researcher the average user spends about 43 minute per month carrying out 34 separate search and look at 1.9 webpage for each hunt. A significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. For 44% of those questioned, the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find. Search engine user also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. According to Pew Research 44% of searcher use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites. Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves, said the result reflected it own research which showed that people use different search engine because the way the site gather information mean they can provide different result for the same query.

Karachi stocks hit historic high,"The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) ha recorded it largest single day gain, surging 3.5% to a new high.

Jubilant investor danced on the street a the market closed for the day on Tuesday, confident that the boom will continue at least until the public holiday on 22 January. Others, however, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of price overheating, continued to warn that the ""bubble may burst any time"". ""That's rubbish,"" KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani told the BBC News website. ""Whenever the market reflects Pakistan's true economic reality, it is described a a bubble."" Mr Lakhani feel that the market ha risen on the basis of solid economic growth and it current level rest on sound foundations. Market analyst are inclined to agree with Mr Lakhani, arguing that there are a number of major factor behind the KSE's performance. Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan's credit rating by international credit rating agency ha finally begun to register in the market. Standard & Poor's upgraded Pakistan a few week ago. There are indication of yet another upgrade by the end of February. Then, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which ha gone up by 27% from last year. ""Coupled with the 7% GDP growth expected by June this year, I am least surprised at the market's performance,"" say Mr Lakhani. One leading Karachi broker said the real reason may be political. ""If you file a $1.3 trillion case against Saudi money after 9/11, Arab money will not go to the US any more."" A lot of Arab money, he says, ha already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia. Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sector in Pakistan, draw some of the Arab money to the KSE. Locally, too, say analysts, recent political development have worked to the market's advantage. An anti-Musharraf campaign threatened by the MMA, a countrywide alliance of religious parties, ha fizzled out. The release of Asif Zardari, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's husband, ha eased political tension between the military-backed government and the opposition Pakistan People's Party. Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talk between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir ha not automatically led to heightened tensions. This, they say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of their disagreements. The market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the US, a country seen locally a deeply interested in defusing tension between the South Asian neighbours.

Vera Drake's Bafta triumph hope,"At the Bafta film award on Saturday night, there is the prospect that a home-grown movie could walk off with a clutch of trophies. Vera Drake, Mike Leigh's tale about a 1950s backstreet abortionist, is nominated in 11 categories. These include best film, best director and best actress shortlist for Imelda Staunton who play the eponymous character. The film ha spent month being lauded with prizes, from the Venice Film Festival to five award from the London Critics' Circle on Wednesday night. The Baftas ha a tradition of honouring British cinema, and this year Vera Drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise. Empire magazine's review editor Dan Jolin said the film had ""a very good chance"" of doing well on Saturday, predicting that it would collect five or six awards. ""I don't think it's going to do a Lord of the Rings-style sweep, but Imelda Staunton is a shoo-in for best actress,"" he said. ""A best director prize for Mike Leigh and best British film are also likely and it could steal some award from heavily-nominated competitor The Aviator and Finding Neverland."" Mr Jolin tipped another contender - most likely The Aviator - to walk away with the Bafta for best film, and added that Finding Neverland had been lavished with nomination but not trophies. Strong Oscar contender Million Dollar Baby and Sideways did not figure in the Bafta nominations, giving Vera Drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes. ""There is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guy on the back. Out of all the film in the running for the Baftas, Vera Drake is the true blue British one."" ""If Mike Leigh is going to win award for anything, it should be Vera Drake at this year's Baftas"", said Mr Jolin, adding that the film wa probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet. Mr Jolin also tipped Phil Davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in Vera Drake but felt that Heather Craney could be outdone by Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman in the supporting actress category. ""If there is anywhere where this film is going to win, it will be at the Baftas,"" he said. The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw felt that there ""might well be"" a sweep of award for Vera Drake on Saturday night. ""I hope that Bafta voter will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film. If Bafta can't do so, what hope is there?"" he said. Mr Bradshaw felt that Mike Leigh's ""masterpiece"" wa entitled to the best film award - leaving Dead Man's Shoes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, My Summer of Love and Shaun of the Dead to slug it out for the best British film trophy.

""We're seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow UWB on a licence-exempt basis,"" said a spokesman for Ofcom. Companies have until 24 March to respond. In April the EC is due to start it own consultation on Europe-wide adoption of UWB. The cross-Europe body for radio regulators, known a the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme. Early sight of the CEPT work ha caused controversy a some think it over-emphasises UWB's potential to interfere with existing users. By contrast a preliminary Ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy UWB without causing problem for those that already use it. The Ofcom spokesman said it wa considering imposing a ""mask"" or set of technical restriction on UWB-using devices. ""We would want these device to have very strict control on power level so they can not transmit a long way or over a wide area,"" he said. Despite the current restriction the technology is already being used.

Mobiles 'not media players yet',"Mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing, all-dancing multimedia device which will replace portable medium players, say two reports. Despite move to bring music download service to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia service with size and battery life, said Jupiter. A separate study by Gartner ha also said real-time TV broadcast to mobile is ""unlikely"" in Europe until 2007. Technical issue and standard must be resolved first, said the report. Batteries already have to cope with other service that operator offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel camera and game amongst others. Bringing music download service based on the success of computer-based download service will put more demand on battery life. Fifty percent of Europeans said the size of a mobile wa the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone, but more power demand tend to mean larger handsets. ""Mobile phone music service must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience a the handset are not yet ready,"" said Thomas Husson, mobile analyst at Jupiter research. ""Mobile music service should be new and different, and enable operator to differentiate their brand and support third generation network launches."" Other problem facing mobile music include limited storage on phones, compared to portable player which can hold up to 40GB of music. The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of Apple's iTunes, Napster and other net music download services. With phone getting smarter and more powerful, there are also demand to be able to watch TV on the move. In the US, service like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre-recorded TV content onto their phones. But, the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. Currently, TV-like services, where clip are downloaded, are offered by several European operators, like Italy's TIM and 3. Mobile TV will have to overcome several barrier before it is widely taken up though, said the report. Various standard and way of getting TV signal to mobile are being worked on globally. In Europe, trial in Berlin and Helsinki are making use of terrestrial TV mast to broadcast compressed signal to handset with extra receivers. A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation let people watch TV programme on their mobile 24 hour a day. The service us 3GP technology, one of the standard for mobile TV. But at the end of 2004, the European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) a the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe. Operators will be working on the standard a a way to bring real-time broadcast to mobiles, a well a trying to overcome several other barriers. The cost and infrastructure need to set up the service will need to be addressed. Handsets also need to be able to work with the DVB-H standard. TV service will have to live up to the expectation of the digital TV generation too, which expects good quality image at low prices, according to analysts. People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens, said Gartner. Digital video recorders, like Europe's Sky+ box, and video-on-demand service mean people have much more control over what TV they watch. As a result, people may see broadcasting straight to mobile a taking away that control. More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common.

US data sparks inflation worries,"Wholesale price in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six year in January, according to government data. New figure show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, a the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory. The economic figure come on the back of increased fear that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rate in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed ha been raising interest rate at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation doe not get out of control. Mr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank wa on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. ""The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rate at a measured pace,"" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. ""But this Michigan survey tell you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in term of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that."" Consumer spending account for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed a a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it wa overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. ""The concern is that trader might interpret this big jump in the core PPI a an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,"" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's.

But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, a the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor's 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory. The economic figure come on the back of increased fear that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rate in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed ha been raising interest rate at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation doe not get out of control. Mr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank wa on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures."

Chelsea denied by James heroics,"A brave defensive display, led by keeper David James, helped Manchester City hold the leader Chelsea. After a quiet opening, James denied Damien Duff, Jiri Jarosik and Mateja Kezman, while Paul Bosvelt cleared William Gallas' header off the line. Robbie Fowler should have scored for the visitor but sent his header wide. Chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but James kept out Frank Lampard's free-kick and superbly tipped the same player's volley wide. City went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat Chelsea this season. And there wa little to alarm them in the first 30 minute a Chelsea - deprived of Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. Indeed, it wa the visitor who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. Shaun Wright-Phillips - watched by England bos Sven-Goran Eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball, which wa blocked by John Terry. But Chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. First, Duff got round Ben Thatcher and blasted in a shot that James parried to Kezman, who turned the ball wide. Soon afterwards, Jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head Lampard's corner goalwards but James tipped the ball over. Chelsea were now looking more like Premiership leader and James kept out Kezman's fierce drive before Bosvelt and James combined to clear Gallas' header from Duff's corner. City broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in Fowler celebrating his 150th Premiership goal. Wright-Phillips raced down the left and crossed to Fowler but City's lone man up front, left free by Terry's slip, contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough wa certain. The second half started a quietly a the first, although James wa forced to divert a cross from the lively Duff away from Eidur Gudjohnsen's path. There wa a nasty moment for Petr Cech, looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league, when a series of ricochet saw Fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the Czech Republic stopper. Another quiet spell followed, which Duff interrupted with a surging run that wa halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by Bosvelt. Lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and James somehow blocked it with his legs. Another timely challenge, this time from Richard Dunne in time added on, prevented Gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. There wa still time for James to produce a sensational save to tip Lampard's volley round the post.

Domain system scam fear,"A system to make it easier to create website address using alphabet like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body ha warned. The Internationalised Domain Names system ha been a work in progress for year and ha recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force. But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammer create fake site more easily. The problem lie in the computer code used to represent language. Registering name that look like that of legitimate company but lead user to fake site designed to steal password and credit card detail could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, say Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. Domain name are the ""real language"" address of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. So-called ASCII code are used to represent European language but for other language a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. So, for example, website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain a displayed to the user would look identical to the real site a a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead user to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A fake Paypal.com ha already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who ha followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer. As the idea wa to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain ha now been handed back to Paypal but it set a worrying precedent, Mr Dyer said. ""Although the IDN problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their website can be faked,"" said Mr Dyer. ""It is important to alert user that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what look like a perfectly genuine site,"" he added. There are solutions. For instance, browser could spot domain that use mixed character and display them in different colour a a warning to users. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browser could be a case of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water,"" he said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees. ""A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browser into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world,"" the organisation said in a statement.",tech,"A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer.But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake.As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, Mr Dyer said.The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'.A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF.So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used.But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily.The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force.",0.05157342657342656,"A system to make it easier to create website address using alphabet like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body ha warned.

Turkey knocks six zeros off lira,"Turkey is to relaunch it currency on Saturday, knocking six zero off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering it growing economy.

The Turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs. Turkey had to turn to the International Monetary Fund for financial assistance, accepting a $18bn loan in return for pushing through a wide-ranging austerity programme. These tough measure have borne fruit. Inflation fell below 10% earlier this year for the first time in decade while export are up 30% this year. Meanwhile, the economy is expanding at a healthy rate, with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. The government hope that the new currency will cement the country's economic progress, two week after EU leader set a date for the start of Turkey's accession talks. The slimmed-down lira is likely to be widely welcomed by the business community.

Wilkinson to miss Ireland match,"England will have to take on Ireland in the Six Nations without captain and goal-kicker Jonny Wilkinson, according to his Newcastle bos Rob Andrew. Wilkinson - who had targeted the 27 February match for his international comeback - ha been missed by England, not least for his goal-kicking. ""Jonny's not fit yet,"" Falcons chief Andrew told BBC Radio Five Live. ""He won't be fit for Dublin, there's no doubt about that, but he might be fit for Scotland and Italy."" The 25-year-old ha not played for England since the 2003 World Cup final after a succession of injuries. England, who have lost three Six Nations game in a row, wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to France. Goal-kickers Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley missed six penalty attempt and a drop-goal between them. ""They've probably got two of the best English kicker in the Premiership in Hodgson and Barkley,"" added Andrew, a former England fly-half and goal-kicker. ""They're both pretty good kickers. Charlie is a good kicker week-in, week-out. ""But it's all about pressure and unfortunately England are just not handling the pressure at the moment."" Andrew also blamed England's poor run of recent result on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirement and injuries. ""They just didn't have that leadership that would have seen them through. Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny are obviously huge loss and leadership is so important in those situations,"" he said. ""I think it is really difficult for Jason Robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back."" Meanwhile, former England full-back Dusty Hare put England's mistake down to a lack of mental toughness. ""Jonny Wilkinson ha proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate,"" Hare told BBC Radio Five Live. ""But natural-born toughness come into it a well a all the practice you do. ""You have to be able to shut out all the outside element and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts."" Hodgson, who ha an excellent kicking record with club side Sale Sharks, ha introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late.
